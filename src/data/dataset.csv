with environmental regulations, economic development, and
industrialization: Evidence from 288 cities in China","Given the global focus on climate change and sustainable development, understanding the impact of China’s
fiscal decentralization on carbon emissions is essential for supporting green transformation and achieving carbon
peaking and neutrality targets. This study examines data from 288 Chinese cities between 2003 and 2021, using
fixed effects, moderation effects, and threshold effects models to assess the relationship between fiscal decen-
tralization and carbon emissions, alongside its interaction with environmental regulation, economic develop-
ment, industrialization, and city hierarchy. The results show that fiscal decentralization significantly aids carbon
reduction, but stronger environmental regulations have not effectively slowed emission growth, creating a ""green
paradox."" Relaxed regulations prioritize short-term economic gains, leading to underinvestment and fragmented
regulatory efforts, which weaken emissions control. As economic development advances, fiscal decentralization’s
impact on carbon emissions shifts from positive to negative. Additionally, with increasing industrialization, the
negative influence of fiscal decentralization on emission intensity becomes more pronounced. In non-first-tier
cities, weak regulatory enforcement and limited autonomy hinder effective carbon reduction policies. To
address these issues, the central government should enhance guidance and oversight of local environmental
policies, ensure strict enforcement, optimize fiscal resources for environmental investment, and promote green
economic transformation. A tailored approach to fiscal decentralization is needed to balance economic growth
with environmental protection, achieving mutually beneficial outcomes","Fiscal decentralization

1,"NAMBER: A biotic index for assessing the ecological quality of
mesophotic biogenic reefs in the northern Adriatic Sea","he aim of the present study was to propose a biotic index (North Adriatic
Mesophotic BiogEnic Reefs, NAMBER) suitable for assessing the ecological quality
of the mesophotic biogenic reefs of the northern Adriatic continental shelf based
on photographic sampling.
2. At each of the 20 study sites, the degree of bioconstruction (expressed as
percentage cover of crustose coralline algae), the α-diversity (expressed as the
mean number of taxa), and the degree of sensitivity to human disturbance and
climate change (based on literature data and expert judgement) of the benthic
assemblages were selected as descriptors and combined in the NAMBER index,
using the best values that the three metrics can currently achieve in the studied
region as a reference.
3. The study highlighted that there was large spatial heterogeneity among reefs and
high variability in the ecological quality values obtained by NAMBER, ranging from
bad to high. The index indicates that reefs lying furthest from the coast, under
substantially lower anthropogenic pressure, have a generally higher status of
environmental quality. However, a clear geographical pattern did not emerge, as
reefs close together often had different ecological qualities.
4. The NAMBER index, which combines three ecological descriptors, in accordance
with the requirements of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive,
represents a specific adaptation to the northern Adriatic Sea of a multimetric
index previously developed for the north-western Mediterranean Sea, capitalizing
on previous knowledge and research efforts.
5. This multimetric biotic index provides an effective standardized tool for
monitoring programmes and environmental impact assessments in the northern
Adriatic mesophotic biogenic reefs and lays the foundation for ecosystem-based
management and conservation in this basin","

2,"Conceptual guidelines for the implementation of the  
ecosystem approach in biodiversity monitoring","The theoretical concept of the ecosystem approach (EA) aims at assessing ecosystem function 
based on integrative assessments of multiple levels of biological organization. Since the United Nations 
Convention on Biological Diversity in 1992, the EA has been increasingly integrated into environmental 
policy and legislation, but to date, its practical implementation remains vague with a lack of universal 
guidelines and concrete recommendations for its use across ecosystem boundaries. On the basis of a re-
view of scientific literature, worldwide environmental legislation and existing monitoring approaches, 
we identified the most important factors which hamper the feasibility of the EA. We propose a general-
ly applicable methodology for implementing the EA in ecological and environmental monitoring across 
different ecosystems and habitat types. Successful application of the EA largely depends on adequately 
standardized and synchronized sampling designs for all abiotic and biotic components, appropriate depth 
of taxonomic identification, and sufficient spatial and temporal replication. The proposed step- by- step 
guidelines for using the EA are valid across ecosystem types, geographic regions, and for a variety of data 
types, making them promising tools for ecological monitoring","biodiversity; ecosystem change; environment; impact assessment; multiple taxonomic groups; multivariate

3,Expertise and Public Participation in the Context of Nuclear Risk: Democracy and Environmental Licensing of Angra 3,"This article discusses the specificity of citizens' ""participation"" in contexts of decision-making on the acceptance of nuclear risk, demonstrating that such acceptance depends on mediation by professionals who are willing to translate the typical scientific jargon of technical reports and/or produce their own reports, by way of counter-expertise; otherwise, lay people are unable to confer scientific legitimacy to their arguments. The basic empirical references for the current analysis are the recurrent themes from public hearings organized for licensing of two Brazilian nuclear power plants using German technology, Angra 2 and Angra 3, with an emphasis on the latter, now undergoing prior environmental licensing.

5,Reforming EIA systems: A critical review of proposals in Brazil,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) systems are under pressure in many countries, driven by a call for efficiency
and streamlining. Such a phenomenon is particularly clear in Brazil,where, in the past fewyears, a number
of influential associations put forward documents proposing significant changes to environmental licensing and
impact assessment regulations. So far, there is no publicly available information about any initiative towards
scrutinizing those proposals. The objective of this study was to critically review the merits and drawbacks of
the changes proposed in those documents. The analysis triangulated content analysis, focus group and online survey
data. The focus group included ten seasoned Brazilian EIA specialists; the survey, based on Likert-scale and
open-ended questions, resulted in 322 valid responses from EIA professionals. Results show that the proposals
generally agree that the current EIA system, while playing a key role in mitigating impacts and enhancing project
design, needs many changes.Nonetheless, the proposals neither offered solutions to overcomepolitical, technical
and budget barriers, nor established a sense of priority of the most urgent issues. Findings from the focus group
and the survey signaled that a number of proposed actions might face public outcry, and that those changes that
do not depend on legislative action are more likely to be implementable. Previous studies about EIA reform focused
mostly on the context of developed countries after changes had taken place. This study, while addressing
the perspective of a large developing country in a “before-reform” stage, shows that capacity-building is a key requirement
in EIA reform.","Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)

6,"A Scenario Based Impact Assessment of Trace Metals
on Ecosystem of River Ganges Using Multivariate Analysis
Coupled with Fuzzy Decision-Making Approach","The growing consciousness about the health risks associated with environmental
pollutants has brought a major shift in global concern towards prevention of hazardous/
trace metals discharge in water bodies. Majority of these trace metals gets accumulated in
the body of aquatic lives, which are considered as potential indicators of hazardous
content. This results in an ecological imbalance in the form of poisoning, diseases and
even death of fish and other aquatic lives, and ultimately affect humans through food
chain. Trace metals such as Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn originated from various
industrial operations containing metallic solutions and agricultural practices, have been
contributing significantly to cause aquatic pollution. The present study develops a novel
approach of expressing sustainability of river’s ecosystem based on health of the fish by
coupling fuzzy sensitivity analysis into multivariate analysis. A systematic methodology
has been developed by generating monoplot, two dimensional biplot and rotated compo-
nent matrix (using ‘Analyze it’and ‘SPSS’software), which can simultaneously identify
critical trace metals and their industrial sources, critical sampling stations, and adversely
affected fish species along with their interrelationships. A case study of assessing the
impact of trace metals on the aquatic life of river Ganges, India has also been presented
to demonstrate effectiveness of the model. The clusters pertaining to various water quality
parameters have been identified using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine
actual sources of pollutants and their impact on aquatic life. The fuzzy sensitivity analysis
reveals the cause-effect relationship of these critical parameters. The study suggests
pollution control agencies to enforce appropriate regulations on the wastewater dischargers
responsible for polluting river streams with a particular kind of trace metal(s)","Aquatic ecosystem . Fuzzy decision-making . Impact assessment . Multivariate

7,"Spatial and temporal response of multiple trait-based indices to
natural- and anthropogenic seafloor disturbance (effluents)","To support ecosystem-based management and achieve the Good Environmental Status (GES) of marine
waters it is important to better comprehend the relationships between biodiversity and environmental
disturbance (anthropogenic and natural). Biotic indices are widely used in studies to help understanding
these relationships and to assess the environmental status of waters. In recent years, trait-based indices
rapidly emerged as an alternative ‘functional’ approach to serve this purpose. In this study, we analysed
how two indices based upon the mean (community-weighted mean trait value–CWM) and the diversity
of multiple traits (Rao’s quadratic entropy–Rao) in a macroinvertebrate community respond to natural-
and anthropogenic seafloor disturbance (effluents) and we compared their performance with the widely
used AMBI and M-AMBI. Our results demonstrate that CWM and Rao were not effective in indicating
anthropogenic disturbance in the Basque coast, Bay of Biscay. The main reason was probably that many
traits did not have a strong link with this type of disturbance. Besides, the mechanistic links between
certain traits and their response to anthropogenic seafloor disturbance in marine environments is cur-
rently not well understood. From a management perspective: the CWM does not provide a single value
indicating a quality status, which makes it a difficult tool to use and interpret. This index is probably more
useful for scientists who want to explore and understand different aspects of community functioning. On
the other hand, Rao and other indices expressing trait diversity do provide a single value of functioning;
therefore they could potentially be effectively used for management purposes. However, to improve its
performance, detailed and accurate trait data is required, which is currently lacking for many marine
species","Ecosystem functioning

9,"Is environmental impact assessment fulfilling its
potential? The case of climate change in renewable
energy projects","One of the topics receiving much attention in recent years is climate change and the potential of its integration in impact
assessment, both in terms of achieving mitigation and adaptation. Renewable energy projects are part of the efforts to
mitigate climate change, replacing the use of fossil fuel with CO2-neutral energy sources. A variety of these projects are
subject to environmental impact assessment (EIA), which raises the following questions: What role does an impact
assessment play? When is the project environmentally friendly? How are climate change-related impacts assessed in
projects with inherent positive effects on climate change? This paper reviews practice, and takes up these questions based on
a document study of 19 EIA reports of renewable energy projects in Denmark. The results show that climate change
mitigation is included in 18 of the EIA reports reviewed, while adaptation is absent. Also, the results show an emphasis on
positive impacts in the reports, and in a few cases discussions of enhancements. Identification and assessment of negative
climate change impacts are less apparent. This leads to a discussion of the results in the light of the purpose of EIA",environmental impact assessment; climate change; renewable energy; positive impacts; enhancement ,1.0

However, as has been expounded throughout this study, there are still several gaps and limitations in the

Data were obtained from noise measurements and interviews with the population, generating the following indicators: equivalent sound level (Leq ), traffic noise index (LTNI ), and a participatory diagnosis (Dp ), integrated through a fuzzy inference system (FIS). The proposed system allowed classifying the measurement points according to the degree of impact of noise pollution on the population's health (IPS ) in the study area. Impact was considered significant in 31.4% of the measurement points and very significant in 62.9%.

12,Setting boundaries of participation in environmental impact assessment,"Public participation processes are touted as an effective way to increase the capacity and legitimacy of environmental
assessment and the regulatory process that rely on them. Recent changes to the Canadian environmental
assessment process narrowed the criteria for who can participate in environmental assessments from any who
were interested to those who were most directly affected. This article examines the potential consequences of
this change by exploring other areas of Canadian regulatory law where a similar directed affected test has
been applied. This new standard risks institutionalizing the long-understood representational bias confronted
by more diffuse interest like environmental protection. Restricting participation to the “directly affected” is far
too narrowa test for processes like environmental assessment that are designed to determine the public interest.","Environmental impact assessment

The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is one of these instruments. The article presents a comparative analysis of the licensing process for hydroelectric plants in Brazil, the United States, Canada and China. The objective is to evaluate the tools used in energy planning in comparative perspective, in order to identify lessons that could be absorbed by the Brazilian institutional framework. Through this analysis, it is possible to verify that the processes of environmental licensing in different countries are similar in their origins, developments, structure and defects. However, lessons can be drawn for the Brazilian reality in view of the results and the need for strengthening this institutional frame", hydroelectricity; impact assessment; natural resources. ,1.0

15,The policy dimension of energy transition: The Brazilian case in promoting renewable energies (2000–2022),"Policies can play a central role in the energy transition by promoting renewable sources. The successful
implementation of sustainable energy and climate policies requires political will and public support. Governments
in many countries are taking measures to drive changes in energy systems and incentivize renewable
energies. Drawing on the Brazilian regulations and the database from the National Agency of Electric Energy, in
this article, we examine the public policy design and implementation to boost renewable energy, as well as the
emerging configuration of the sectoral governance that stems from energy policies. The installed electricity
capacity in Brazil is mostly renewable due to hydropower. However, territorial matters of hydropower plant
locations in areas with high biodiversity, the uncertainty about future water availability, and the impact of
climate change on water resources impose a challenge on sectoral planning for understanding the spatial and
water-energy nexus to avoid unintended consequences, as well as to promote alternative renewable energies.
Strategies for expanding alternative sources need to consider, the growing presence of private agents (national
and international) in the electricity sectoral configuration, which can shape national policies seeking their interest.
Thus, the sectoral policy must seek to engage them in the decarbonization policy. On the other hand,
adequate territorial planning, regulations, and policies that may shape the nature of the expansion, pace, and
direction of the low-carbon energy transition also need to be considered.","Energy transition

It has been developed through a bottom-up compilation of existing SEA effectiveness KPIs from the international literature, and then sieving these by: A) ensuring they tackle current practice weaknesses for SEA in Ireland; B) aligning them with strategic/tactical/operational success factors for effective SEA; C) prioritising them on the basis of feedback from SEA experts; and D) further refining them through project steering committee opinion.

20,Environmental Compensation in Planning: A Review of Five Different Countries with Major Emphasis on the German System,"Abstract
The use of different measures to compensate the environment when human development projects take place has been frequently discussed in both Europe and the USA. This paper reviews the use of environmental compensation in Germany, the USA, the Netherlands, the UK and Sweden. In Germany compensation methods have been used since the 1970s. In the USA there are requirements for mitigation and compensation measures for wetland losses. In the Netherlands, the compensation measures are focused on certain protected areas. In the UK there are few legal instruments that formally require environmental compensation. In Sweden the new environmental legislation has made it possible to legally demand environmental compensation measures to gain permits for exploitations. However, these new Swedish requirements have only been available since 1999 and the use of compensation measures needs to be developed. In this article we argue that the German environmental compensation practice is most developed and is worth further study in order to develop the use of environmental compensation methods in the Swedish planning system.

As such, fiscal and monetary policies can drive renewable energy. To this end, the current study proposes a new

development; in contrast, the contractionary monetary policy aligns with a reduction in renewable generation in 
the selected BRI countries. The moderating role of political stability in driving the monetary policy-renewable 
energy development and fiscal policy-renewable energy in these countries remain instrumental. The outcomes 
were reaffirmed by changing the estimator, testing the relationship with different fiscal and monetary policy 
indicators, and using the asymmetric analysis of the benchmark model to support the regression results. Finally,

22,A living lab learning framework rooted in learning theories,"Complex  issues  like  sustainable  land  and  water  management  demand  a  transdisciplinary  and  collaborative 
approach, such as that of living labs, bridging between science, policy, and society. Living labs facilitate active 
collaboration among diverse actors from public and private sectors, research institutes, and civil society, creating 
an environment that fosters innovations to address environmental challenges. However, the impact of these labs 
is often assessed based only on their immediate results, overlooking the potential effects of learning during co- 
creation  activities.  Thus,  this  paper  develops  a  framework  that  allows  to  capture  learning  in  a  living  lab  co- 
creative  environment.  In  response  to  widespread  calls  for  an  epistemological  basis  for  living  labs,  the  study 
bases the framework on relevant learning theories. First, the literature dealing with learning theories relevant to 
the characteristics of living labs is reviewed. The relevant theories are identified as: behaviorism, cognitivism, 
constructivism,  experimental,  situated,  social,  organizational,  transformative,  and  connectivism.  Next,  the  in-sights on learning theories are used in developing a Living Lab Learning Framework with three interacting com-ponents:  A.  Learning  types  (what),  B.

learning outcomes. The framework distinguishes content, capacity, and network as learning types; intentional or 
incidental as learning processes; and individual, team, and organization as learning levels. Finally, the potential 
application of the framework during the initiation, implementation, and evaluation project phases of living labs 
is highlighted.  The framework is envisaged to extend the impacts of  living labs beyond immediate results by

The land-energy-food-waste nexus based on system dynamics model","Transforming agricultural systems to mitigate climate change challenges is one of China’s most urgent tasks. The 
land, energy, food and waste nexus (LEFWN) in the agricultural sector not only improves resource efficiency but 
also has the potential to contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG). However, existing studies have 
not yet evaluated the potential impact of policy implementation on mitigating GHG within the LEFWN system, 
especially in identifying trade-offs and synergies. This study developed a system dynamics model (SDM) based on 
historical data from 2011 to 2020 in Jiangxi, China, incorporating positive and negative feedback mechanisms. 
This model generated five primary policy scenarios and eleven derived scenarios. The findings show that the 
SDM highlighted dynamic characteristics and nonlinear relationships within the LEFWN systems. The integrated 
scenario, which includes bioenergy development, land use policies, and the substitution of organic fertilizers for 
chemical fertilizers, can potentially decrease GHG emissions by up to about 14.20 %. Significant trade-offs exist 
between food security policies and other policies, depending on the strategic objectives pertaining to land, en-ergy, or waste management. Policymakers can benefit from a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic 
interplay  between  agricultural  resources  and  assessing  the  effectiveness  and  utility  of  different  strategies.

25,The significance spectrum and EIA significance determinations,"The concept of significance is fundamental to environmental impact assessment (EIA). Even though there are many
guidelines describing technical characteristics of impacts (such as magnitude, geographic extent, extent and frequency) that
should be considered, there has remained a long-standing need for increased clarity on how significance determinations are
ultimately reached by significance determiners, those who, on behalf of governments, make a legal determination of
significance in EIAs. This involves the application of societal values, in the form of subjective informed judgement, about
the acceptability of the predicted impacts. This paper introduces the significance spectrum, a graphic model that illustrates a
process for determining significance, using the following steps: (1) determining the threshold of significance for each valued
component; (2) weighing the evidence and considering predicted impacts; (3) deciding which side of the threshold the
predicted adverse impact falls on; and (4) for unacceptable impacts, deciding if mitigations can make the residual impact
acceptable. Concepts such as ecological significance should not be confused with significance in EIAs, which may not only
include ecological significance but also considers societal values. We provide specific steps for determining significance that

27,"A Typology of Stakeholders and Guidelines for Engagement in Transdisciplinary, Participatory Processes","This paper fulfils a gap in environmental management by producing a typology of stakeholders for effective participatory processes and co-design of solutions to complex social–environmental issues and then uses this typology for a stepwise roadmap methodology for balanced and productive stakeholder engagement. Definitions are given of terminology that is frequently used interchangeably such as “stakeholders,” “social actors,” and “interested parties.” Whilst this analysis comes from a marine perspective, it is relevant to all environments and the means of tackling environmental problems. Eleven research questions about participative processes are addressed, based on more than 30 years of experience in water, estuarine, coastal, and marine management. A stepwise roadmap, supported by illustrative tables based on case-studies, shows how a balanced stakeholder selection and real engagement may be achieved. The paper brings these together in the context of several up-to-date concepts such as complex, nested governance, the 10 tenets for integrated, successful, and sustainable marine management, the System Approach Framework and the evolution of DPSIR into DAPSI(W)R(M) framework. Examples given are based on the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, the Framework Directive for Maritime Spatial Planning, as well as for Regional Sea Conventions. The paper also shows how tools that have been developed in recent projects can be put to use to implement policy and maximize the effectiveness of stakeholder participation.","Stakeholders, transdisciplinary research, coastal and marine management, implementation of MSFD ",0.0
28,"Indicators quantifying small pelagic fish interactions: application
using a trophic model of the southern Benguela ecosystem","Three indicators quantifying interactions between species are developed for an upwelling system to provide useful mea-
sures for the comparison of marine ecosystem structure and function. Small pelagic fish are dominant in upwelling systems,
and by definition, they are pivotal in a wasp-waist upwelling system. The indicator of interaction strength (IS) quantifies
the effect that a change in biomass of one group has on abundance of other groups. The functional impact (FI) indicator
quantifies the trophic impacts of species on their own and other functional groups or feeding guilds. The trophic replacement
(TR) indicator quantifies the trophic similarity between a species that is removed from an ecosystem and other species in
that ecosystem, i.e. it quantifies the ability of one group to trophically replace another. A trophic model of the southern
Benguela ecosystem is used as an example for the application of the indicators. The strong similarities in trophic function-
ing of the southern Benguela ecosystem in the anchovy-dominated system of the 1980s, and the 1990s when there was a
shift towards greater sardine abundance, are explained by the mutual trophic replacement abilities of anchovy and sardine.
Differences between the proposed indicators and mixed trophic impact assessment are highlighted, mainly resulting from
the static versus dynamic nature of the models upon which they are based. Trophic indicators such as those presented here,
together with other kinds of ecosystem indicators, may assist in defining operational frameworks for ecosystem-based fisheries

enterprises green technological innovation (GTI) and the underlying mechanisms. The study found that Chinese 
enterprises' OFDI significantly enhances both the quantity and quality of domestic GTI. The placebo and PSM- 
DID tests confirm the robustness of this conclusion. The heterogeneity analysis suggests that Chinese enter-prises' direct investment in countries that have rigorous environmental regulations and high technological levels 
can promote both the quantity and quality of domestic GTI. Mechanism  analysis indicates that enterprises 
influenced by high environmental compliance pressure can effectively increase both the quantity and quality of 
GTI  through  OFDI;  however,  enterprises  under  strong  environmental  media  supervision  through  OFDI  can 
significantly enrich the quantity of GTI but not the quality. Enterprises' OFDI enhances the quality of domestic 
GTI by increasing research and development funding and the number of research personnel. Furthermore, this 
study reveals that Chinese enterprises' OFDI significantly promotes the quantity of green process innovation and 
the quality of green product innovation. However, the effect on the quality of green process innovation and the 
quantity of green product innovation is not statistically significant. Moreover, particularly in reducing the quality 
of green process utility innovation, Chinese enterprises' OFDI significantly improves the quality of green product

30,Brazil’s Samuel Dam: Lessons for Hydroelectric Development Policy and the Environment in Amazonia,"Brazil’s Samuel Dam, which formed a 540-km2
reservoir in the state of Rondônia in 1988, provides lessons
for development decisions throughout Amazonia and in other
tropical areas. The decision to build the dam was heavily influenced
by its role in the political strategies of key decision makers.
Samuel illustrates both impacts and benefits of electricity
supply and the dilemmas facing decision makers regarding
the various options for planned electricity generation. Environmental
costs included flooding forest and stimulating illegal
logging activity throughout western Amazonia because of an
exception opened for Samuel in Brazil’s prohibition of export
of raw logs. Samuel emitted substantially more greenhouse
gases than would have been emitted by generating the same
amount of electricity from oil. Contamination of fish in the reservoir
resulted from methylation of mercury present in the soil.
Social costs of the dam included resettlement of 238 families
of farmers; impacts on indigenous people were indirect. Mitigating
measures included faunal rescue and creation of a forest
reserve. The lessons of Samuel include the need to consider
a full range of alternatives prior to making decisions in
practice and the importance of adhering to the logical sequence
of decision making, where information is gathered and
compared prior to the decision. It also shows the need to
maintain flexibility when the costs and benefits of different alternatives

Data were collected using documents provided by the entrepreneur and semi-structured interviews of 15 stakeholders. We performed content analysis on the information obtained, along with literature discussion. Community representatives and external stakeholders reported not knowing about the SLO term and expected more benefits for the affected region. We observed that the main characteristic SLO results occurred in the phases preceding project operations. After the project was completed, the relationship among the parties weakened. Although it can’t be possible to measure SLO level based on data from this case study, we point that SLO must take participatory systems, collective work, environmental protection, and social guarantees into account at all enterprise life cycle, to promote honest pathways for regional development.

Eastern Canada","This study presents the results of the first broad-scale, spatial cumulative impact analysis (SCIA) conducted for 
colonial-nesting seabirds at-sea in eastern Canada. Species distribution models, based on at-sea tracking data for 
thirteen species/groups of seabirds (n ¼520 individuals), were applied to over 5000 species-specific colonies to 
map relative abundance patterns across the entire region. This information was combined with distributional 
data  for a  number of  key anthropogenic  threats  to quantify  exposure  to fisheries,  light  and ship-source  oil 
pollution, and marine traffic. As a final step, information about species-specific sensitivity to each threat was 
integrated to compute region-wide cumulative risk. 
The data products permit the visualization of the interaction between species and threats, and confirm that 
large portions of the coastal zones of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, as well as the Grand Banks shelf break, 
constitute areas where breeding seabirds experience the highest potential impact. The cumulative risk maps 
revealed that species which were either widespread throughout coastal areas (e.g., gulls), or capable of foraging 
long distance (Leach’s Storm-Petrel), were most at risk. Cumulative risk maps help identify appropriate and 
potentially effective management and conservation actions, and are of value to federal regulators responsible for

patterns  of  fish  community  composition  and  biodiversity  in  seasonal  no-take  river-
ine  sanctuaries  in  Bangladesh,  which  aim  to  conserve  the  anadromous  hilsa  shad  
(Tenualosa spp. and Hilsa keele). Fish samples were collected during monsoon, as well 
as pre- and postmonsoon, from five sites within two sanctuaries and one site in an 
open fishing area. Although total abundance was similar along the rivers, species rich-
ness was significantly higher at the open fishing site due to its connectivity to nearby 
habitats.  The  diversity  apparently  decreased  in  a  downstream  direction.  Fish  com-
munities at two upstream sites were separated from other sites in multivariate space 
largely due to higher abundance of hilsa at downstream sites and presence of flood-
plain-oriented species at the two upstream sites. Short body length and high trophic 
level at all sites indicated that fish communities were overexploited. Our results also 
indicated that riverine hilsa sanctuaries in Bangladesh are rich in fish species diversity 
and  support  several  threatened  species  designated  by  the  International  Union  for

37,Advances in cumulative effects assessment and application in marine and coastal management,"Quantifying and managing the cumulative effects of human activities on coastal and marine
environments is among the foremost challenges in enabling sustainable development in the
twenty-first century. As the speed with which these environments are changing increases, there
is greater impetus to resolve the evident problems facing governance systems responsible for
managing cumulative impacts. Policymakers and regulators recognise the need to assess and
manage cumulative effects, as evidenced by widespread legislation requiring cumulative effects
assessment (CEA). Yet there is ample evidence that we are not turning the tide in terms of
balancing good environmental health with increasing demands of already degraded coastal and
marine spaces that are increasingly impacted by climate change. This paper reviews the current
state of knowledge regarding scientific and practical advances in CEA, assesses whether these
advances are being applied in decision-making and identifies where challenges to implementation
exist. Priority research questions are formulated to accelerate the inclusion of effective CEA

mitigation devoted to other impacts - especially on water - have potential to address impacts on ecosystem

found that, where salmon are abundant, fisheries can harvest large fractions of runs
without substantially reducing bear consumption of salmon, but that watershed devel-

opportunities by reducing population-level variation in salmon spawn timing. Habi-

first million-tonne CCUS-EOR project","CCUS, an emerging technology for reducing carbon emission, plays a crucial role in achieving the goal of carbon 
neutrality. CCUS technology exemplified by CO2  enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is gradually progressing from 
project demonstration to large-scale application. However, the commercial application still faces uncertainties in 
economic cost, energy efficiency and environmental benefits. This paper takes China’s first million-tonne CCUS-

comprehensive research framework for evaluating CCUS from the three dimensions of energy, environment, and

results demonstrate that during the project lifecycle, when the average oil price is $90/bbl, the project’s NPV is 
$56.09 million, the project’s IRR is 13.4 %, the payback period is 8.34 years, and the threshold oil price for the 
project to be economically profitable is $81.52/bbl. Furthermore, the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) of the 
project is 9.09, which considerably superior to that of the Shengli Oilfield’s non-EOR, and the net energy output

This potential can be best leveraged when regulatory aspects are tiered by performance criteria in “performance-based” policies. Although recognized as an essential part of incentivizing performance improvements, these polices present a significant challenge for developing countries.
This paper presents a definition and the basic elements of performance-based regulations, and a case study in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Starting with a brief discussion of public environmental policy instruments, the performance-based concept is defined and examined, using the experiences of the U.S. to list the most relevant characteristics by which a public policy can help regulators to not only recognize but also to reward and encourage environmental performance improvement.
The introduction of performance criteria into the renewable permits in Sao Paulo State, Brazil, is described as an example of these practices. By establishing an innovative permitting model, the state environmental agency encourages continuous environmental performance improvements in industries. Some preliminary results are presented with regard to administrative and environmental benefits, with an example of water reuse and wastewater volume reduction at a petrochemical hub to illustrate the strategy's potential.
Finally, the adequacy of the implemented permitting system was evaluated with the performance-based criteria reported in the literature. The results attest to the potential of this model to foster improvements beyond traditional compliance, mainly through the adoption of cleaner production, thereby contributing to environmental quality improvements with low economic, socio and political enforcement costs.", ,1.0

with refined management algorithms. We utilized this model and applied various options for forest management 
based on the available detailed data, including climate change scenarios and policies reflecting possible CRDPs in 
the Republic of Korea. As a result, CO2 sequestration in the 2050s was predicted to be 23.08 million tCO2 year 1

and Statistical Adjustment","Recently the regional impact assessment due to global warming is one of the urgent tasks to every
country in the world, under the circumstances of increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This as-
sessment must include not only meteorological factors, such as surface air temperature and precipita-
tion, etc., but also the response of the local ecosystem. Based on a previous study, for example, it has
been known that Phyllostachys’ habitation, which is one of the bamboo species popular in Korea, is quite
sensitive to temperature change, in particular during the winter season. Thus, adequate climate infor-
mation is essential to derive a solid conclusion on the regional impact assessment for future climate
change.
In this study, we adopted a dynamical downscaling technique to get regional future climate informa-
tion, with the regional climate model (MM5, Pennsylvania State University/ National Center for Atmo-
spheric Research mesoscale model) from the Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology Models and Data
Group’s Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Model (AOGCM) ECAHM4, and HOPE-G (ECHO-G)
simulation for future climate, based on future greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenario of the Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2.
Through this nesting process we got reasonable regional climate change information. However, we found
a couple of systematic differences, such as a cold bias in the surface air temperature, simulated by MM5
compared to that by the AOGCM ECHO-G. This cold bias may cause to loose credibility on the future
climate scenario to the impact assessment studies. Accordingly, we introduced a transfer function to
correct the systematic bias of the dynamic model in the regional-scale, and to predict the regional climate from large-scale predictors. These transfer functions are obtained from the daily mean temperature
of 17 surface observation stations in Korea for 10 years from 1992 to 2001, and 10-year simulation data
obtained from regional climate model (RCM) for each mode of EOFA to correct the systematic bias of
RCM data.
With these transfer functions, we can correct the RMS error of the daily mean temperature in RCM

mass balance model with regional case study data for Portugal. We show that the whole-system GHG emissions 
range for beef production from steers in beef herds is 15–124 kg CO2e per 100 g protein depending on LPS 
(confined, pasture-based or mixed), breed, age at slaughter, and adequacy and upstream impact of supplemental 
feed. If steers are adequately supplemented, then LPS that involve at least a stage of grazing for steers have the 
lowest emissions, regardless of supplemental feed impact. In case of suboptimal supplementation during grazing, 
confinement is optimal at intermediate to low feed impact. For high feed impact, slaughtering at weaning is 
optimal. Choosing the best LPS and slaughtering age reduces the range of emissions to 15–35 kg CO2e per 100 g

52,"Multi-criteria decision models for management of tropical coastal
fisheries. A review","The crisis in the world’s fisheries is attributed to excessive fishing pressure, long-term mismanagement, increased population
growth, development and improvement of fishing technologies, uncertainty in global fisheries catch data, economic incentives and subsidies,
and increasing demand for fish meal. For the coastal fisheries of developing countries, the problem is aggravated by coastal habitat degradation,
widespread poverty in coastal communities, inshore encroachment of commercial fishing vessels, use of illegal and destructive fishing methods,
resource use conflicts, pollution from uplands, and weak institutional arrangements. In response to these problems and in the hope of reversing
their negative effects, fisheries management strategies have emerged for tropical coastal fisheries during at least the past 30 years. In fisheries,
it is crucial to determine the outcomes of management strategies, especially when public money has to be accounted for. However, efforts
to assess their impacts or measure progress are usually directed towards a single disciplinary approach, which fails to consider the multi-
dimensionality of tropical fisheries including concomitant multi-level and conflicting goals and objectives. This article explores the utility
of a multi-criteria type of evaluation as a potential analytical approach in impact evaluation for tropical fisheries management. The general
framework of a multi-criteria evaluation method is a two-dimensional matrix composed of different choice possibilities including the set of
criteria and indicators that will serve as bases in assessing these choice possibilities. The literature presents various criteria and indicators in
fisheries management evaluation, the kinds and number of which would depend on stated goals and objectives of fisheries and the availability
of resources to acquire the information. The type of measurement, i.e., quantitative or qualitative, and the weighing of criteria and indicators
are crucial in the evaluation process because they determine the multi-criteria aggregation approach to be used. Moreover, the participation of
stakeholders and coastal resource users is crucial in complementing scientific information, in developing acceptable solutions, and in reducing
conflicts and distrust in the evaluation and decision-making process. While many aggregation models in multi-criteria analysis in natural
resource management exist, this article limits its review to only six models: the analytic hierarchy process, the weighted sum model, the
ordination technique, concordance analysis, the regime method and Evamix; which are viewed to be applicable to the structure of decision-
making in tropical fisheries management. This article also examines the performance of some of these models through a case study that
determines the impacts of fisheries management strategies in San Miguel Bay, Philippines. The review reveals the following: (1) among the
aggregation approaches, the analytic hierarchy process and ordination technique had the highest number of applications in fisheries while none
was found for concordance analysis, the regime method or Evamix; (2) the application of hybrid models in multi-criteria analysis is increasing
and found to be effective in many environmental decision problems including fisheries; (3) the application of multi-criteria decision models to
fisheries management is relatively scarce during the last 10 years; only 26 papers were found in peer-reviewed journals; and (4) in the choice
of model, its technical assumptions and limitations, its appropriateness for a specific decision-making problem, and its ability to handle the
situation correctly vis-à-vis contextual, technical and political concerns should be considered",multi-criteria decision models /fisheries management /impact evaluation /indicators /criteria /preference system /San Miguel Bay ,0.0
53,"GHG emission efficiency of prefabricated composite subway stations: A 
novel case study of Shenzhen, China","Rapid urbanization has spurred large-scale subway construction and led to the emergence of the prefabricated 
composite subway station (PCSSs), a novel station paradigm that integrates cast-in-situ (CIS) and prefabrication 
techniques,  with significantly different greenhouse gas (GHG) emission boundaries than traditional stations. 
However, GHG emissions from PCSSs remain unclear. Under the current concept of sustainable construction, 
understanding the main GHG emission characteristics is essential to optimize the design and construction mode 
of  PCSSs  and  facilitate  their  initial  development.  In  this  regard,  this  study  innovatively  takes  the  PCSS  in 
Shenzhen Urban Rail Transit Phase 5 as a case study to analyze the PCSS’s GHG emission efficiency from cradle- 
to-end of construction, and explore the key factors affecting GHG emissions. The results indicate that PCSSs 
reduce GHG emissions by 2.98 %–4.91% compared to traditional CIS stations, and interestingly, the PCSS’s GHG 
emissions increase with the increase of prefabrication rate, which is primarily due to the nature of prefabricated 
composite technology. The GHG emissions in the production stage, transportation stage and construction stage 
accounted for 67.38%, 3.16% and 29.46%, respectively, among which the GHG emissions in the PCSS trans-portation  stage  are  3.04%  higher  than  those  in  CIS  stations.  From  a  sub-project  perspective,  the  enclosure 
structure (54.67%) and main structure (43.67%) are the main contributors to GHG emissions. Using formworks 
more than 40 times is effective for low-emission prefabricated composite construction. This study provides a

dominated  by  American  lobster  (Homarus  americanus)  landed  entirely  in  Atlantic  Canada  and  northeastern 
United States. In Atlantic Canada, lobster fishing and marine finfish aquaculture take place in the same coastal 
waters creating the potential for negative environmental, as well as social, interactions. We review the state of 
knowledge of environmental interactions between American lobster, their habitat and fishery, and marine finfish 
aquaculture. We first provide a brief overview of key biological, behavioural, and ecological processes and 
environmental  stressors  of American lobster  at  different  life-history  stages followed  by  an overview  of  the 
pathways of effects of marine finfish aquaculture on coastal ecosystems in general and on American lobster. Our 
review  found  that  certain  finfish  aquaculture-lobster  interactions  have  received  considerable  study  (e.g., 
chemical use), whereas knowledge of other interactions are either limited (e.g., net pens, waste discharges) or 
lacking (e.g., disease, noise, lights, and odours). An ecosystem-based approach to aquaculture has been proposed 
for managing these interactions but implementing this approach has proven to be a challenge in part because of 
complex multi-sector, multi-stakeholder and multi-agency governance issues. While governance solutions await 
development, practical measures based on the results of scientific research identified in this review, such as 
better use of existing oceanographic and bathymetric data, habitat and human impact assessment tools, and 
toxicity information offer regulators ample information and management tools, at least at the farm- and bay- 
scale, to avoid negative finfish aquaculture-lobster interactions in Atlantic Canada. Bridging the governance

consequences of fishing in an ecosystem approach to
fisheries management","Managing fisheries resources to maintain healthy ecosystems is one of the main
goals of the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF). While a number of international
treaties call for the implementation of EAF, there are still gaps in the underlying methodology. One aspect that has received substantial scientific attention recently
is fisheries-induced evolution (FIE). Increasing evidence indicates that intensive fish-
ing has the potential to exert strong directional selection on life-history traits,
behaviour, physiology, and morphology of exploited fish. Of particular concern is
that reversing evolutionary responses to fishing can be much more difficult than
reversing demographic or phenotypically plastic responses. Furthermore, like cli-
mate change, multiple agents cause FIE, with effects accumulating over time. Con-
sequently, FIE may alter the utility derived from fish stocks, which in turn can
modify the monetary value living aquatic resources provide to society. Quantifying
and predicting the evolutionary effects of fishing is therefore important for both
ecological and economic reasons. An important reason this is not happening is the
lack of an appropriate assessment framework. We therefore describe the evolution-
ary impact assessment (EvoIA) as a structured approach for assessing the evolu-
tionary consequences of fishing and evaluating the predicted evolutionary
outcomes of alternative management options. EvoIA can contribute to EAF by clar-
ifying how evolution may alter stock properties and ecological relations, support
the precautionary approach to fisheries management by addressing a previously

65,The attractive concept of simplicity in environmental impact assessment: Perceptions of outcomes in southeastern Brazil,"Pressures are mounting for the simplification of environmental impact assessment (EIA). This phenomenon is drawing increasing scholarly attention, but studies have not gone far beyond speculating what could happen as a result of recently implemented or proposed regulatory changes. This paper takes a more longitudinal look at simplified EIAs. The main objective was to analyze the perceived outcomes of a number of simplified EIA processes, using Brazil as the empirical context. More specifically, this paper aimed at understanding: 1) how simplified EIAs have been conceptualized and implemented in southeastern Brazil; and 2) how developers and civil servants in that region perceive the outcomes of simplified EIAs. This study adopted a sequential mixed method research approach. Data was collected through literature reviews, 261 telephone-based interviews and 10 face-to-face interviews. Degrees of EIA simplification can vary significantly within and across jurisdictions. In any case, simplification is often framed as a win-win solution to EIA ineffectiveness, through which regulatory and procedural changes are made to ease the process, while, at the same time, maintaining or providing better environmental protection. This approach is more frequently applied to potentially low-impact processes. Chi-square tests of the data collected through telephone interviews in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais indicated that developers tend to perceive EIA processes as difficult and slow regardless of how simplified it is. Most civil servants, who were directly involved in the implementation of simplified EIAs in state environmental agencies, argued that simplified EIAs are driven mostly by environmental agencies, as these institutions have long been unable to cope with an ever-increasing load of license applications. Policy outcomes of simplified EIAs in the territory are not sufficiently monitored by state agencies. Civil servants revealed concerns about the potential long term effects of EIA simplification on the ground, as they have had limited resources for audits and inspections.","Environmental impact assessment (EIA), Environmental licensing, Simplification, Streamline, Environmental policy, Brazil ",1.0

We present an approach to predict their effects on benthic communities, and use the approach to estimate the state, the biomass relative to carrying capacity, of the Baltic Sea at the local, habitat, and regional scale. Responses to both pressures are expected to depend on the longevity of fauna, which is predicted from benthic data from 1558 locations. We find that communities in low-salinity regions mostly consist of short-lived species, which are, in our model, more resilient than those of the saline areas. The model predicts that in 14% of the Baltic Sea region benthic biomass is reduced by at least 50%, whereas an additional 8% of the region has reductions of 10–50%. The effects of hypoxia occur over larger spatial scales and lead to a low state of especially deep habitats. The approach is based on a simple characterization of the benthic community, which comes with high uncertainty, but allows for the identification of benthic habitats that are at greatest risk and prioritization of management actions at the regional scale. This information supports the development of sustainable approaches to manage impact of human activities on benthic ecosystems.","benthic fauna, bottom fishing, ecosystem-based management, human pressures, impact assessment, oxygen deficiency, seabed disturbance ",0.0

conservation and fishery interests are common and
increasing, and there is often a glaring lack of dialogue
between stakeholders representing these two interests. There is
a need for a stronger and enforced coordination between fishing
and conservation authorities when establishing marine
protected areas for conservation purposes. We propose that
an appropriate instrument for such coordination is a broad
ecosystem-based marine spatial planning procedure,
representing neither nature conservation nor fishery. Strategic
environmental assessment for plans and programmes and
environmental impact assessment for projects are commonly
used tools for assessing the environmental impacts of different
human activities, but are seldom used for evaluating the
environmental effects of capture fisheries. The diversity of
fisheries and the drastic effects of some fisheries on the
environment are strong arguments for introducing these
procedures as valuable supplements to existing fisheries
assessment and management tools and able to provide
relevant environmental information for an overall marine
spatial planning process. Marine protected areas for nature
conservation and for protection of fisheries have different
objectives. Therefore, the legal procedure when establishing
marine protected areas should depend on whether they are
established for nature conservation purposes or as a fisheries
resource management tool. Fishing in a marine protected area
for conservation purpose should be regulated according to
conservation law. Also, we argue that marine protected areas
for conservation purposes, in the highest protection category,
should primarily be established as fully protected marine
national parks and marine reserves.","Ecosystem-based management Fishery 

Wind energy is among the fastest-growing renewable energy source. Although not as controversial as fossil fuel-based

issues and concerns raised by government reviewers, project interveners, and other affected interests. Fifty different issues
were identified. Although variability existed among the number and diversity of issues by jurisdiction and by project,
depending on location and size, concerns about land use, impacts on human well-being, impacts on natural ecosystems, and
economic opportunity, represented nearly 80% of all issues and concerns. The majority of issues reflect project-specific
impacts and concerns, but many issues including impacts to other land tenure holders or licensees (such as other utilities and
industries) are issues that are beyond the scope and scale of what can be resolved at the time wind energy projects are
proposed. Understanding and addressing recurrent issues and concerns and shifting the bigger issues to the planning and

for assessing benthic status, there is a lack of quantitative baselines in benthic diversity that
would enable comparisons across broad spatial scales, encompassing different environmental
settings and bioregions. By taking advantage of long-term monitoring data, spanning
hundreds of stations over the past 40 years, we provide a comprehensive analysis of benthic a,
b, and c diversity, encompassing the entire salinity gradient of the open sea areas of the large,
brackish-water Baltic Sea. Using a relatively simple measure, average regional diversity, we
define area-specific reference conditions and acceptable deviation against which to gauge
current conditions in benthic macrofaunal diversity. Results show a severely impaired
condition throughout large areas of the Baltic for the assessment period 2001–2006. All
ecosystems are plagued by baselines that shift in time and space, and their definition is not
trivial, but average regional diversity may offer a transparent way to deal with such changes in
low-diversity systems. Identifying baselines will be of increasing importance given the potential
of climatic drivers to interact with local anthropogenic stressors to affect patterns of
biodiversity. Our analysis provides an evaluation of the current condition in a system that has
been heavily influenced by anthropogenic impact and changing oceanographic conditions, and
it provides a basis for future impact assessment and ecosystem-based management","average regional diversity; Baltic Sea; benthic diversity assessments; diversity gradients;

nature and pace o f   change in the Bay o f   Quinte ecosystem are reviewed, spanning from colonization by the Empire

The review includes the long-term scientific study o f   the B a y ' s   response to point-source phosphorus control (Project 
Quinte) and the recent efforts to develop and implement a  coordinated clean-up program (Remedial Action Plan). 
From the lessons o f   the Quinte experience, a framework is derived, combining the illness and wellness approaches 
to health.  The framework deals  with five topics: uncertainty and the precautionary principle;  an ecosystem health 
scale;  indicators  of ecosystem health;  m a x i m u m    allowable  change;  and,  regulation  and  planning.  Uncertainty 
should not be used  to justify  inaction.  A  precautionary principle assumes  that  impacts  will  occur  and  places  the

economic destruction. They disturbs the ecological framework of the oceans and other water bodies causing
major losses to the aquatic biodiversity. The risk associated with oil spills raise a lot of policy issues on the safe
transport of oil volumes. Efficient removal of these spills is an absolute necessity for the protection of the oceanic
environment and life. Onshore and offshore oil response strategies with continuous monitoring systems must be
applied at the spill site to minimize the harmful impacts on the environment and human health. Currently used
remediation technologies are still not effective to completely restore the polluted marine environment to its
normal ecology. Nanotechnology is proving to be a valuable tool in cleaning up of these oil spills or leaks in the
water by utilizing magnetic nanomaterials such as functionalized super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles
(SPIONs), magnetic nanocomposites and magnetic carbon nano tubes (CNTs). Functionalization of nanoparticles
using different functional moieties such as organic non-polymeric and inorganic molecules, polymers and
polysaccharides renders them with novel features like enhanced adsorption capacity and high oil removal efficiency.
Innumerable researches have emerged in developing novel counter measures to mitigate the dangerous
impacts of oil spills. The present review emphasizes the environmental impacts of major oil spills in maritime

construction sector due to water scarcity","Global water scarcity poses a significant threat to economic production, especially within resource-intensive 
sectors such as construction. It is essential to assess the potential local economic output loss from water scar-city in the construction sector and the distant repercussions from upstream sectors for sustainable construction 
practices. Our study aims to evaluate the potential local economic output loss in the construction sector due to 
water scarcity, taking into account spatially heterogeneous environmental flow requirements. Additionally, we 
quantify the distant impact from upstream sectors using a multi-regional input-output model. This study em-phasizes the need to identify countries, sectors, and national sectors severely affected by water scarcity using 
potential economic loss per unit of output value. The results indicate that the construction sectors in Gabon, the 
Czech Republic, and the Central African Republic are the most severely affected by water scarcity. The potential 
distant economic loss in the construction sector primarily stems from the quarrying of stone, sand, and clay 
sector, as well as the non-metallic mineral products sector. Hotspots at the national-sector level are also iden-tified. The findings of this study can help policymakers in the construction sector identify key countries affected

Medicine facilitate the cross-policy harmonization on managing socio-
ecological systems?","EU's Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 sets a 15% restoration target. However, the understanding of restoration as a
management tool remains ambiguous at EU and Member State levels.
As a country with rich biodiversity but low GDP, a well-defined priority setting approach is key for Bulgaria. The
“Methodological framework for assessment and mapping of ecosystem condition and ecosystem services in
Bulgaria”proposes a transition towards ecosystem management and monitoring of the Socio-Ecological System
(SES), to be embedded in the environmental policy framework.
We extend the analogy between SES and the human body's system in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as
a way to inform restoration priority setting and development of restoration and monitoring tools at several
levels:
1. Overall objective: the sustainability goals correspond to the TCM's objective of a healthy, balanced body
2. Restoration objectives and functioning: the desired ecosystem state can be better understood in analogy be-
tween the ecosystem structure and functioning framework for multiparametric optimization, and the TCM
framework of Ying-Yang, Eight principles, Five elements and organs
3. Ecosystem monitoring: Integrated monitoring may benefit from comparison to TCM diagnostics
4. Ecosystem management approaches can benefit from the analogy to the TCM system of meridians
We apply the analogy and find that spatially explicit decision making on restoration, streamlined ecosystem
monitoring and a number of other issues (green infrastructure, designation of protected areas, defragmentation and connectivity, cumulative impact assessment, etc.), are easier to understand, communicate, account for and
manage. Ecosystem restoration is priority for China and the country has accumulated research and practical ex-

79,Is environmental impact assessment regulation a ‘burden’ to private firms?,"The impact of environmental regulation on macroeconomic performance has been
studied in some depth over the last 15 years. Similarly, impact on profit performance,
investment intention and location decisions of firms has also been studied, although in less
depth. There has been less academic interest, however, in the impact that environmental
regulation has on the strategic objectives of companies.
This article reports on a research project that focused on the impact that environmental
approvals regulation (predominantly environmental impact assessment, EIA) has on
proposed new development in the international mining sector.
Based on a large and externally valid survey of senior mining company executives in
Australia and Canada in the late 1990s, the research indicated that a significant majority of
firms consider the environmental approvals process to be an important determinant of
investment strategy. An initial reaction to these figures might suggest that the majority of
respondents believe the environmental approvals process to be a negative influence.
However, further questioning indicated that only a small proportion of companies in
both countries thought of the environmental approvals process as an impediment to
development. Instead, it is clear that most firms see EIA as a catalyst for integrating
environmental design into the early planning of a project, thereby alleviating the need to
spend money on overcoming environmental problems once a poorly designed project has
been commissioned.
The somewhat surprising conclusion that companies see environmental approvals
regulation as important, but as an encouragement to development rather than as an impediment, goes against much previous industry and academic comment and, at least in
relation to the mining sector, refutes the idea that EIA is ‘‘burdensome’’.","Environmental regulation and firms; Environmental approvals; Environmental impact

74 EIA follow-up reports that were identified and acquired. Second, a reviewing framework, containing 16
different indicators, was developed to systematically document and classify these EIA follow-up reports. Third,
these EIA follow-up reports were grouped into several categories according to various indicators and then were
analyzed to recognize their key features, including sources of data, analytic tools adopted, spatial-temporal
distribution, industrial distribution, triggering causes, content, structure and effectiveness. The results showed
that there were considerable disparities in the quality and the rigor of EIA follow-ups conducted. These features,
along with some existing deficiencies of EIA follow-up, such as the lack of corresponding monitoring and
management, can greatly limit the overall application and effectiveness of EIA follow-up in China. However, a
number of good practices were identified. For example, a list of projects subject to mandatory EIA follow-up was
promulgated, and the conditions for projects subject to EIA follow-up were explicitly stipulated in regulations.
These good practices would be very helpful for the international EIA community to advance the practice of EIA

quantified during 2013–2016. In total, more than 190 taxa were identified. Stable isotopic analyses (δ13C, δ15N) 
on the tissues of these megafauna were used to provide complementary data to reveal their trophic relationships. 
Ecopath models were constructed to show the flow of matter within deep-sea ecosystems. There were four integer 
trophic levels in both deep-sea models. Most of the omnivory indices of the megafauna in the models were small, 
indicating the specialized diet niches of the megafauna. The mixed trophic impact results showed that both 
models were top-down controlled. Seep-associated king crabs were the keystone group in the seep model. These 
crabs not only transferred energy from lower trophic levels to top predators but also linked energy from seeps to 
neighboring deep-sea ecosystems. However, the low number of trophic connections between the seep animals 
and neighboring deep-sea communities indicates the uniqueness of the seep ecosystems in the deep sea. All the 
biomass, matter flow and trophic transfer efficiency values were higher in the seep model than in the model 
without seeps. The higher overhead/capacity ratio in the seep model than in the model without seeps suggests 
that the former model was more resilient to perturbations than the latter model. Although the net primary 
production and matter flow in the seep model were lower than those in the shallow-sea models, the models had 
comparable values of biomass excluding detritus. The relatively high system omnivory indices and low matter 
cycling of both deep-sea models indicate that these models were more mature than the shallow-sea models.

Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) chapters identified scope for improvement at almost every stage of
the EcIA process, regardless of country. However, there have been no reviews of UK EcIA chapters since
2000, despite important changes in biodiversity and planning legislation, policy and guidance. In
addition, no UK EcIA chapter reviews have attempted to assign a grade or score to EcIA chapters (as has
been done for reviews of US, Finnish and Indian EcIA chapters). Furthermore, no EcIA chapter reviews
have attempted to use a scoring system to identify which variables determine EcIA chapter information
content, beyond straightforward comparisons of EcIA chapters before and after the introduction of
guidelines.
A variant of the Biodiversity Assessment Index (BAI) was used to assign scores between zero and one to
EcIA chapters based on a series of 47 questions drawn from EU legislation and professional guidance. 112
EcIA chapters for proposed developments that were subsequently granted planning permission in England
were assessed. The mean BAI score was less than 0.5, indicating the presence of considerable
information gaps in the majority of EcIA chapters.
Of 13 predictor variables identified as having the potential to affect EcIA chapter quality, 10 were
identified as significantly related to the BAI scores. A backward stepwise Generalized Linear Model
identified the use of professional guidance, the ecological consultancy type and the length of the EcIA
chapter as having the greatest combined explanatory power. As a result, several recommendations are
made to help improve future EcIA chapter content, including formal EcIA chapter review, publicising the
professional guidance to consultants, the provision of training and the introduction of an accreditation
scheme for consultants involved in EcIA
This approach could be replicated in other countries that conduct EIA. Context-dependent EcIA chapter
review criteria (as in this paper) would help to identify targeted recommendations for improvement.

effective response is to use an appropriate scientific lens to peer through the mist of uncertainty that threatens timely and appropriate decisions
surrounding these complex issues. Identifying such corridors of clarity could help understanding critical phenomena or causal pathways
sufficiently well to justify taking policy action. To this end, we suggest four principles: Follow the strongest and most direct path between
policy decisions on outcomes, focus on finding sufficient evidence for policy purpose, prioritize no-regrets policies by avoiding options with
controversial, uncertain, or immeasurable benefits, aim for getting the big picture roughly right rather than focusing on details","global environmental change, science–policy interface, sufficient evidence, uncertainty ",1.0
95,"Estimating sensitivity of seabed habitats to disturbance by bottom
trawling based on the longevity of benthic fauna","Bottom fishing such as trawling and dredging may pose serious risks to the seabed and
benthic habitats, calling for a quantitative assessment method to evaluate the impact and guide man-
agement to develop mitigation measures. We provide a method to estimate the sensitivity of benthic
habitats based on the longevity composition of the invertebrate community. We hypothesize that long-
lived species are more sensitive to trawling mortality due to their lower pace of life (i.e., slower growth,
late maturation). We analyze data from box-core and grab samples taken from 401 stations in the Eng-
lish Channel and southern North Sea to estimate the habitat-specific longevity composition of the
benthic invertebrate community and of specific functional groups (i.e., suspension feeders and biotur-
bators), and examine how bottom trawling affects the longevity biomass composition. The longevity
biomass composition differed between habitats governed by differences in sediment composition
(gravel and mud content) and tidal bed-shear stress. The biomass proportion of long-lived species
increased with gravel content and decreased with mud content and shear stress. Bioturbators had a
higher median longevity than suspension feeders. Trawling, in particular by gears that penetrate the
seabed >2 cm, shifted the community toward shorter-lived species. Changes from bottom trawling
were highest in habitats with many long-lived species (hence increasing with gravel content, decreasing
with mud content). Benthic communities in high shear stress habitats were less affected by bottom
trawling. Using these relationships, we predicted the sensitivity of the benthic community from bottom
trawling impact at large spatial scale (the North Sea). We derived different benthic sensitivity metrics
that provide a basis to estimate indicators of trawling impact on a continuous scale for the total com-
munity and specific functional groups. In combination with high resolution data of trawling pressure,
our approach can be used to monitor and assess trawling impact and seabed status at the scale of the
region or broadscale habitat and to compare the environmental impact of bottom-contacting fishing
gears across fisheries","benthic fauna; ecosystem-based management; effects of trawling; impact assessment; indicators; sea

96,Assessing the cumulative environmental effects of marine renewable energy developments: Establishing common ground,"Assessing and managing the cumulative impacts of human activities on the environment remains a major challenge to sustainable development. This challenge is highlighted by the worldwide expansion of marine renewable energy developments (MREDs) in areas already subject to multiple activities and climate change. Cumulative effects assessments in theory provide decision makers with adequate information about how the environment will respond to the incremental effects of licensed activities and are a legal requirement in many nations. In practise, however, such assessments are beset by uncertainties resulting in substantial delays during the licensing process that reduce MRED investor confidence and limit progress towards meeting climate change targets. In light of these targets and ambitions to manage the marine environment sustainably, reducing the uncertainty surrounding MRED effects and cumulative effects assessment are timely and vital. This review investigates the origins and evolution of cumulative effects assessment to identify why the multitude of approaches and pertinent research have emerged, and discusses key considerations and challenges relevant to assessing the cumulative effects of MREDs and other activities on ecosystems. The review recommends a shift away from the current reliance on disparate environmental impact assessments and limited strategic environmental assessments, and a move towards establishing a common system of coordinated data and research relative to ecologically meaningful areas, focussed on the needs of decision makers tasked with protecting and conserving marine ecosystems and services.",Cumulative effects assessmentCumulative effectsMarine renewable energyEnvironmental impact assessmentEcosystem approachMarine management ,1.0

constraints, industry requirements and conservation issues","This paper presents a methodology for the selection of coastal sites for finfish cage farming, based on
both satellite remotely sensed data and mathematical models. Such methodology can be applied, at
screening level, also in areas where field data are lacking, and consists in two steps. In the first one,
candidate areas are ranked according to criteria which take into account the risk of cage breaking due to
wave actions and fish welfare requirements. This step involves the post-processing of satellite data and
results of operational oceanographic models by means a multi-criteria methodology implemented in a
GIS environment. In the second step, an integrated aquaculture impact assessment model is applied to
the most suitable areas in order to obtain a preliminary assessment of the potential interaction of a newly
established cage with benthic habitats. The methodology was applied to an Algerian coastal area near the
town of Bejaia where the central government is planning to develop aquaculture activities. Results show
that the procedure allows to perform a site selection, which combines the quality of a site from the
aquaculture use perspective with the conservation of endangered benthic habitats (Posidonia oceanica
meadows) under the spatial restrictions imposed by existing activities. This result goes in the direction of
defining site selection methodologies complying with the principles of the ecosystem approach to

(PBL) unwittingly embarked on a transition from a technocratic model of
science advising to the paradigm of ‘‘post-normal science’’ (PNS). In
response to a scandal around uncertainty management in 1999, a Guidance
for ‘‘Uncertainty Assessment and Communication’’ was developed with
advice from the initiators of the PNS concept and was introduced in
2003. This was followed in 2007 by a ‘‘Stakeholder Participation’’ Guidance.
In this article, the authors provide a combined insider/outsider perspective
on the transition process. The authors assess the extent to which the PNS
paradigm has delivered new approaches in the agency’s practice and analyze two projects—on long-term options for Dutch sustainable development
policy and for urban development policy—the latter in somewhat more
detail. The authors identify several paradoxes PBL encounters when putting
the PNS concept into practice. It is concluded that an openness to other

102,"An assessment of the psychologically restorative effects of the 
environmental characteristics of university common spaces","The psychological health of university students has become a focal point for researchers worldwide. The field of 
environmental psychology introduces the notion of a “restorative environment”, which can help promote psy-chological health, and increasing research has demonstrated that environmental characteristics play a significant 
role in psychological health. University common spaces enable a range of daily behavioural activities and play a 
critical role in the psychological development of university students. Consequently, it is necessary to evaluate the 
psychologically restorative effects on the environmental characteristics of university common spaces. In this 
study, 408 common spaces across 11 university campuses in Guangzhou were considered as research objects, and 
a deep learning full convolutional network (FCN) program was used to identify the environmental characteristic 
elements  of  these  common  spaces.  Based  on  the  identification  results,  five  representative  categories  and  25 
common space forms were selected for further quantitative analysis based on k-means clustering. The psycho-logically restorative effects of the environmental characteristics of the 25 common space forms were evaluated 
using the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS). The findings indicate that (1) the environmental characteristics 
of the 25 common space forms can explain university students’  psychologically restorative scores. Both archi-tectural  and  landscape  environmental  characteristics  directly  and  significantly  impacted  the  psychologically 
restorative evaluations of university students. (2) Each common space’s environmental characteristic elements 
contributed differently to the psychologically restorative evaluation. The psychological restoration of university 
students was primarily affected by three characteristic elements: the green view index, waterscape coverage, and 
openness  of  building  enclosures.  (3)  Considering  the  environmental  elements  related  to  university  students’ 
psychological restoration and their respective magnitudes of influence, a predictive model of the psychologically

impact significance determination practices change for positive as compared with negative impacts, for
cumulative as compared with individual impacts, for socio-economic as compared with bio-physical
impacts, when the Precautionary Principle is integrated into the process, and when sustainability contributions
drive the EIA process and related impact significance determinations. These refinements can
assist EIA practitioners in ensuring that the scope and nature of impact significance determinations reflect
the broadened scope of emerging EIA requirements and practices. Suggestions are included for further

Policy design and effectiveness in such towns are significantly impacted by the city's economic dependence on a single company. This paper explores the perceived effectiveness of government and voluntary private sector mining policies for pursuing sustainability in the historic mining town of Itabira, Brazil over a period of 20 years. Itabira serves as a worthwhile case study because it allows for an in-depth and longitudinal analysis that can reveal valuable lessons to policymakers of different sectors and jurisdictions located elsewhere. Based on extensive face-to-face interviews and literature reviews, study results indicate that changes to the state environmental licensing policies in the 1990s led to significant socio-environmental improvements in the area. The globalization of the mining company also contributed to an increase in the quantity and quality of voluntary industry policies. Recent technological improvements in the beneficiation processes of the mining company promises to extend the life of the mine to 2050.

to technical failure and/or management problem most of them are facing serious secondary pollution such as
groundwater contamination and odor nuisance. The latter is themain reason causing a growing number of public
complaints. Atmospheric dispersion models are routinely adopted for odor impact assessment, but thesemodels
provide deterministic predictions only. To determine the potential odorant paths and treat the uncertainty of
odor pollution, Monte Carlo simulation coupled with an odor dispersion model was proposed and named
Monte Carlo-dispersion simulationmethod (MCDSM). By introducing a series of random values of error components
in the dispersion model, MCDSM can produce probabilistic odor impact results. Values of these variances
were randomly selected according to their probability density functions (PDFs) due to the imprecise knowledge
of themeteorological and emission conditions. After running the odor dispersion model for numerous times, the
randomization produces a set of possible results that closely resembles the expected behavior of the odorants.
This study applied MCDSMto estimate the odor impact of methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) on anMSWlandfill in Beijing,
China. The PDF of the CH3SH emission rate was derived from the field data. The uncertainty of odor impact
was analyzed statistically, and the results were summarized using the probability of odor exceedance (POE). A

These workshop modelling exercises are used to identify data and conceptual weaknesses in the collective understanding of how complex systems operate, and to allow exploration of the effects of alternative management strategies.

The trial consisted of a training course for modellers and three workshops focused on Great Lakes problems: Lake Trout rehabilitation, Sea Lamprey control, and Fisheries Management.
After the workshops, it was decided that a comprehensive review of the entire exercise should be conducted. A BOTE committee was therefore charged with reviewing both the workshops and the AEAM process. The committee used questionnaires to gauge the opinions and reactions of workshop participants and fishery agency managers — the primary clients for such workshops. Reports and participant feedback were also reviewed.

The results showed that, overall, there was a majority of support among participants and clients for both the past and future potential uses of the AEAM methodology.
However, the results also highlighted areas where the workshops and their impact could be significantly improved — for example, by addressing smaller problems, increasing preparation before the workshops, ensuring greater involvement of participants in all phases, conducting deeper analyses of uncertainties, and improving communication of results to decision-makers in both research-planning and management contexts.

118,"Population- level consequences of seismic surveys on fishes: An 
interdisciplinary challenge","Offshore activities elevate ambient sound levels at sea, which may affect marine fauna. We reviewed the literature about impact of airgun acoustic exposure on fish in terms of damage, disturbance and detection and explored the nature of impact assessment at population level. We provided a conceptual framework for how to address this interdisciplinary challenge, and we listed potential tools for investigation. We focused on limitations in data currently available, and we stressed the potential benefits from cross-species comparisons. Well-replicated and controlled studies do not exist for hearing thresholds and dose–response curves for airgun acoustic exposure. We especially lack insight into behavioural changes for free-ranging fish to actual seismic surveys and on lasting effects of behavioural changes in terms of time and energy budgets, missed feeding or mating opportunities, decreased performance in predator-prey interactions, and chronic stress effects on growth, development and reproduction. We also lack insight into whether any of these effects could have population-level consequences. General “population consequences of acoustic disturbance” (PCAD) models have been developed for marine mammals, but there has been little progress so far in other taxa. The acoustic world of fishes is quite different from human perception and imagination as fish perceive particle motion and sound pressure. Progress is therefore also required in understanding the nature and extent to which fishes extract acoustic information from their environment. We addressed the challenges and opportunities for upscaling individual impact to the population, community and ecosystem level and provided a guide to critical gaps in our knowledge.","airgun,behaviouralresponse,dynamicenergybudget,fishhearing,populationconsequencesofacousticdisturbance,stressphysiology ",0.0

120,A Catalogue of Marine Biodiversity Indicators,"A Catalogue of Marine Biodiversity Indicators was developed with the aim of providing the basis for assessing the environmental status of the marine ecosystems. Useful for the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), this catalogue allows the navigation of a database of indicators mostly related to biological diversity, non-indigenous species, food webs, and seafloor integrity. Over 600 indicators were compiled, which were developed and used in the framework of different initiatives (e.g., EU policies, research projects) and in national and international contexts (e.g., Regional Seas Conventions, and assessments in non-European seas). The catalogue reflects the current scientific capability to address environmental assessment needs by providing a broad coverage of the most relevant indicators for marine biodiversity and ecosystem integrity. The available indicators are reviewed according to their typology, data requirements, development status, geographical coverage, relevance to habitats or biodiversity components, and related human pressures. Through this comprehensive overview, we discuss the potential of the current set of indicators in a wide range of contexts, from large-scale to local environmental programs, and we also address shortcomings in light of current needs. Developed by the DEVOTES Project, the catalogue is freely available through the DEVOTool software application, which provides browsing and query options for the associated metadata. The tool allows extraction of ranked indicator lists best fulfilling selected criteria, enabling users to search for suitable indicators to address a particular biodiversity component, ecosystem feature, habitat, or pressure in a marine area of interest. This tool is useful for EU Member States, Regional Sea Conventions, the European Commission, non-governmental organizations, managers, scientists, and any person interested in marine environmental assessment. It allows users to build, complement or adjust monitoring programs and has the potential to improve comparability and foster transfer of knowledge across marine regions.","assessment, non-indigenous species, food webs, seafloor integrity, pressures, Marine Strategy Framework Directive ",0.0
121,"Characterization of waterborne nitrogen emissions
for marine eutrophication modelling in life cycle impact
assessment at the damage level and global scale","Purpose Current life cycle impact assessment (LCIA)
methods lack a consistent and globally applicable characteri-
zation model relating nitrogen (N, as dissolved inorganic ni-
trogen, DIN) enrichment of coastal waters to the marine eu-
trophication impacts at the endpoint level. This paper intro-
duces a method to calculate spatially explicit characterization
factors (CFs) at endpoint and damage to ecosystems levels, for
waterborne nitrogen emissions, reflecting their hypoxia-
related marine eutrophication impacts, modelled for 5772 riv-
er basins of the world.
Methods The proposed method combines environmental fate
factors (FFs) integrating (i) DIN removal processes in soils
and rivers, based on the NEWS 2-DIN model, and in coastal
waters, based on water residence time; (ii) coastal ecosystem
exposure (XF) to N enrichment, based on biological cycling
processes; and (ii) effect factors (EFs) based on species sensi-
tivity to hypoxia. Three emission routes are discriminated as N
from soil and N in emissions to river and to coastal waters.
Damage factors (DFs) are also estimated, based on endpoint
metric conversion from potentially affected to potentially dis-
appeared fractions of species (i.e. potentially affected fraction
(PAF) to PDF m3 year kg N−1) and harmonization across coastal ecosystems based on spatially explicit density of de-
mersal species, to further express CFs as species year per
kilogram N−1.
Results and discussion Endpoint CFs show 6 orders of mag-
nitude (o.m.) spatial differentiation amongst the river basins
for the soil emission route, 4 for the river and 2 for emissions
to coastal waters. Damage CFs vary 7, 5 and 3 o.m. for the
same routes. After aggregation at the level of continents, max-
imum CFs and DFs are consistently found in Europe, but the
aggregation reduces spatial differentiation to 1 o.m. for each
route in both factors. The FFNsoil and species density terms are
responsible for most of the spatial differentiation of the dam-
age model. Uncertainty is higher for the residence time term
used in the FF model, due to scarcity and inconsistency of data
sources, the assumptions of representativeness of DIN persis-
tence and removal rates.
Conclusions Major contributions to the current state-of-the-
art of marine eutrophication characterization modelling are
(i) full pathway coverage, thus reaching damage level; (ii)
significant increase in geographic coverage; (iii) mechanistic
modelling of exposure and effect factors; and (iv) application
of spatially explicit damage to ecosystems factors based on
species densities. Application of the developed CFs in life
cycle impact assessment is recommended at a river basin

122,Assessing Benthic Responses to Fishing Disturbance Over Broad Spatial Scales That Incorporate High Environmental Variation,"Marine benthic habitats are modified by a number of human-related disturbances. When these disturbances occur at large scales over areas of high environmental variability, it is difficult to assess impacts using metrics such as species richness or individual species distributions because of varying species-specific responses to environmental drivers (e.g., exposure, sediment, temperature). Impact assessment can also be problematic when assessed at broad spatial scales because of regional heterogeneity of species pools. Even when effects on individual species can be detected, it is difficult to upscale from individual species to ecosystem scale effects. Here, we use a functional group approach to assess broad scale patterns in ecological processes with respect to fishing and environmental drivers. We used data from field surveys of benthic communities from two large, widely separated areas in New Zealand’s EEZ (Chatham Rise and Challenger Plateau). We assigned 828 taxonomic units (most identified to species) into functional groups related to important ecosystem processes and likely sensitivity to, and recovery from, fishing disturbance to the seafloor. These included: opportunistic early colonists; substrate stabilisers (e.g., tube mat formers); substrate destabilisers; shell hash-creating species; emergent epifauna; burrowers; and predators and scavengers. Effects of fishing disturbance on benthic functional composition were observed, even at this broad spatial scale. Responses varied between functional groups, with some being tolerant of fishing impacts and others showing rapid declines with minimal fishing effort. The use of a functional group approach facilitates assessment of impacts across regions and species, allowing for improved generalisations of impacts to inform management and decision making","fishing disturbance, functional group, functional traits, spatial scale, Chatham Rise, New Zealand ",0.0
123,"Biodiversity impacts from water consumption on a global scale
for use in life cycle assessment","Purpose Agriculture is a major water user worldwide, poten-
tially depriving many ecosystems of water. Comprehensive
global impact assessment methodologies are therefore re-
quired to assess impacts from water consumption on biodiver-
sity. Since scarcity of water, as well as species richness, varies
greatly between different world regions, a spatially differenti-
ated approach is needed. Therefore, our aim is to enhance a
previously published methodology in terms of spatial and
species coverage.
Methods We developed characterization factors for lifecycle
impact assessment (LCIA) targeting biodiversity loss of vari-
ous animal taxa (i.e., birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphib-
ians) in wetlands. Data was collected for more than 22,000
wetlands worldwide, distinguishing between surface water-
and groundwater-fed wetlands. Additionally, we account for
a loss of vascular plant species in terrestrial ecosystems, based
on precipitation. The characterization factors are expressed as
global fractions of potential species extinctions (PDF) per
cubic meter of water consumed annually and are developed
with a spatial resolution of 0.05 arc degrees. Based on the
geographic range of species, as well as their current threat
level, as indicated by the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN), we developed a vulnerability
indicator that is included in the characterization factor.
Results and discussion Characterization factors have maximal
values in the order of magnitude of 10−11 PDF·year/m3 for
animal taxa combined and 10−12 PDF·year/m3 for vascular
plants. The application of the developed factors for global
cultivation of wheat, maize, cotton, and rice highlights that
the amount of water consumption alone is not sufficient to
indicate the places of largest impacts but that species richness
and vulnerability of species are indeed important factors to
consider. Largest impacts are calculated for vascular plants
in Madagascar, for maize, and for animal taxa; in Australia
and the USA for surface water consumption (cotton); and in
Algeria and Tunisia for groundwater consumption (cotton).
Conclusions We developed a spatially differentiated approach
to account for impacts from water consumption on a global
level. We demonstrated its functionality with an application to
a global case study of four different crops.","Animal taxa . Biodiversity . Life cycle impact

This paper examines 11 Canadian road infrastructure project CEAs completed between 1995 and 2011 to determine how VEC selection in CEA is performed, and whether these practices are sensitive to the linear project development context. Document review and semi-structured interviews reveal an absence of VEC selection guidance, late timing of cumulative effects considerations in impact assessment, lack of sensitivity in CEA VEC selection to the unique, linear nature of the road construction projects and a general lack of insightful, creative approaches to CEA VEC selection – ones that better reflect potential impacts to social and economic aspects of the environment – despite it being shown to be a values-driven, subjective process.

128,Remaking science-policy interfaces in the quest for effectiveness,"In this commentary, we return to the interminable
issue of effectiveness (after Cashmore et al. 2004) in
addressing the question posed by the editors on how
the Environmental Assessment (EA1) community might
address persisting challenges and enhance effectiveness.
The editors’ note that increasingly Strategic
Environmental Assessment (SEA) is viewed as ‘seriously
lagging behind its potential’. On the one hand, SEA is
hardly exceptional in this respect as many environmental
governance tools have failed to perform as
expected (Pattberg and Widerberg 2015).
Nevertheless, hard questions should be asked about
any policy tool that is ‘seriously lagging behind its
potential’ in an era where the need for radical societal
transformations are high on scientific and political
agendas.
We argue that new that new ways of organising
the ‘knowledge systems’ (after Cornell et al. 2013)
underpinning the relationship between knowing
and acting are likely to be a key driver of advances
in this field. This leads us to focus in this commentary
on innovation, the production of salient, legitimate
and actionable knowledge, and renewal of
the so-called science-policy interface. A central
claim we make is that is that there has been
a lack of innovation in the EA community’s understanding
of the practical measures for making SEA
effective and that the conceptual and evidential
support for often-proposed practical measures is
typically partial. We ground this claim empirically
by briefly examining examples of the policy recommendations
made in three SEA evaluation studies
that were conducted for European SEA systems. It is
argued that ‘received wisdom’ on practical measures
required to make EA effective has changed
remarkably little since the early 1980s, despite
important theoretical, conceptual and empirical
developments having taken place during this period
of time. We conclude by considering how a renewal
of the science-policy interface, combined with
a willingness to experiment, may provide an important
stimulus to the emergence of innovative thinking
and actionable knowledge.", ,1.0
129,Trends in global warming and human health impacts related to Brazilian sugarcane ethanol production considering black carbon emissions,"Sugarcane produced in Brazil has several environmental advantages. However, burning residues, which leads to GHG and black carbon (BC) emissions, has been used to facilitate manual harvest. BC emissions have a net warming effect and cause health problems. Mechanized harvest without burning is gradually replacing manually harvested burned sugarcane. Global warming potential (GWP) and human health indicators of sugarcane ethanol production in Brazil, in the pre-mechanization (100% burned), current (∼50% burned) and future (100% without burning) scenarios, were calculated. In the past, the GWP of ethanol production was 1.1 kg CO2 eq L−1 and BC emissions were 32.6 kg CO2 eq L−1. The human health impact in disability adjusted life years (DALY) was 3.16E−05 DALY L−1 ethanol. The current ethanol production process has a GWP 46% smaller, while BC emissions are seven times smaller than before mechanization started. The human health impact is currently 7.72E−06 DALY L−1. In the future, with complete mechanization and the integration of first and second generation ethanol, the expected GWP emissions will be 70% smaller, and BC emissions will be 216 times smaller than when all sugarcane was harvested with burning. These results show that ethanol production in Brazil is improving in terms of global warming and human health aspects. Other upstream aspects of ethanol production such as direct and indirect land use change, and downstream impacts such as the emissions of acetaldehydes were not considered in this study, which focused on a major technological shift in residue management in the agricultural phase of sugarcane ethanol production. A broader assessment of the sustainability of ethanol must account for those issues, as well as economic and social aspects. Sugarcane-derived ethanol produced in Brazil has been considered one of the most sustainable biofuels options, but it is essential to identify and promote practices and policies that further improve its production, such as the phase out of pre-harvest sugarcane burning and the increase in ethanol yield per unit of area.", ,1.0

populations? A case study from Austria","In spite of growing evidence pointing to ecological and genetic risks to wild fish populations, artificial propa-

level of monitoring and evaluation of these risks is neglected, especially where fisheries are managed by private
entities. Against this backdrop and with the goal of establishing a more integrated system of ecosystem-based
management, this study aims to identify potential threats from the current practices and patterns of brown trout
management in Austria. We surveyed 26 private brown trout hatchery operations in three Austrian provinces to
examine and categorize the practices in the production of brown trout for stocking. Specifically, we examined
the rearing practices and the “trading networks”among trout farmers for characteristics such as rearing history,
operating principles, broodstock origins and maintenance, and output figures. Several risk-associated practices
emerged, including introduction of brood from divergent lineages outside of Austrian watersheds, translocation
and mixing of fish across major watersheds within Austria, and reinforced domestication across multiple gen-
erations of captivity. These practices jeopardize native populations by disrupting local adaptations resulting
from mixing of native and non-native lineages, reducing genetic diversity within lineages from population
bottlenecks, and lowering success of wild populations from domestication selection within the hatchery en-
vironment. The findings, which identify threats rather than directly measure impacts, are discussed within the
context of concerns on the role of conserving intraspecific diversity for native brown trout fisheries. We conclude
by suggesting the integration of ecological and genetic principles into propagation and stocking practices to
achieve fishery management strategies more compatible with maintaining natural diversity and adaptive po-

of electric vehicles: A comprehensive life cycle assessment","We present a comprehensive analysis of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of two battery electric vehicles 
(BEVs) using detailed teardown data and contrast them with those of four internal combustion engine vehicles 
(ICEVs). We used the teardown data to calculate the production and recycling phases as well as for the vehicle 
dynamics modeling and estimating the utilization phase GHGs. After validating the models and establishing a 
baseline, we analyzed the effect of new trends on their net carbon footprint. Specifically, we considered light-weighting, battery technology, and charging technologies and showed the tradeoff between longer-range BEVs 
and  their  sustainability  as  a  green  alternative  to  ICEVs.  The  GHGs  were  calculated  based  on  a  life  cycle 
assessment, including the vehicles’  production, utilization, and disposal/recycling life. The GHGs of the pro-duction phase were calculated using detailed vehicle teardown data rather than general assumptions about the 
vehicles’  material composition. Similarly, the utilization phase GHGs were estimated by first creating accurate 
dynamic models of the vehicles and validating them against vehicle test data. Then, we analyzed the effect of 
charging type and electricity source on the sustainability of these technologies. These studies showed that the 
average (mixed) US electricity source accounts for about 50 % of GHGs, and changing charging from household 
to station or supercharging can save about 8 % of GHG emissions. Next, we studied the effect of battery tech-nology and lightweighting on EVs’  net GHGs. OEMs have exploited both of these options to reduce the car’s 
weight and improve its electrical consumption during the utilization phase (driving). Our study showed that 
while the higher energy density of battery technologies like NMC and NCAs is attractive for reducing the ve-hicle’s weight and increasing its range, the use of rare materials significantly increases GHG emissions during 
production. Similarly, we showed that lightweighting by substituting steel with aluminum alloys (such as giga- 
casting) adds more production GHGs that significantly offset the savings in electrical consumption achieved 
during the vehicle’s lifetime. Therefore, this study proposes three pivotal considerations in the design and uti-lization of electric vehicles: battery material selection, trade-off analysis for vehicle lightweighting, and adoption

characterize impacts using parameters such as magnitude, likelihood and geographic

extent to which impacts are characterized for social topics, this paper reviewed of the social
assessment sections of 57 environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports from 12 countries.
The review found that 61% attempted to characterize impacts for social topics, while 39% did
not. Of the 61% that characterized impacts, just over half (54%) provided transparent definitions
for effect levels (e.g. low, medium and high). The research results shine a light on the

Case of Fishing Activity in Galicia (Spain)","In the context of fishery management based on the ecosystem-based approach, it is necessary to develop methods

output physical multipliers, an application for the case of fishing in Galicia (Spain) was developed. The results
show that this method is valid for obtaining a more accurate assessment of the possible socioeconomic impacts
arising from a fishing supply shock, considering in equal measure the backward and forward linkages of fishing
activity with other sectors. The defined multipliers permit the assessment and comparison ex ante of different
management scenarios for fisheries. As a consequence, this is a method with the capacity to provide support for a
better decision making to the fishery regulators and other decision-makers, facilitating the implementation of
more holistic management frameworks.","Input-output multipliers, Fisheries, Socioeconomic Impacts, Ecosystem-based management ",0.0

141,Marine ecosystem restoration and biodiversity offset,"The mitigation hierarchy is increasingly used in environmental policy as a way of reconciling economic development
and biodiversity conservation. The principle of the mitigation hierarchy is to avoid, reduce and offset
the environmental impacts arising from development projects by providing ecological gains through conservation
or restoration measures. Most of the research on its implementation to date has focused on terrestrial
ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the relevance of marine ecosystem restoration in meeting offset requirements.
Stemming from a brief literature review on existing restoration techniques for marine ecosystems
(e.g. coral reefs, seagrass meadows, macroalgae beds, ‘green’ marine construction, and marine sediment remediation)
and our experience on Environmental Impact Assessments undertaken in mainland France and in its
oversea territories, we discuss the main criteria ensuring a suitable use of ‘restoration’ practice regarding offset
requirements. We then clarify the different levels of equivalence that should be met when designing offsets
relying on ‘restoration’ techniques. This study aims to clarify to what extent the environmental impacts of
economic activity on marine biodiversity can be offset through marine ecosystem restoration","Restoration

This phenomenon is characterized by emergence of pests and diseases, extreme weather events, such as prolonged drought, high intensity rains, hailstones and frosts, which are becoming more frequent ultimately impacting negatively to agricultural production including rain-fed tea cultivation. Kenya is predominantly an agricultural based economy, with the tea sector generating about 26% of the total export earnings and about 4% gross domestic product (GDP). In the recent years, however, the country has witnessed unstable trends in tea production associated with climate driven stresses. Toward mitigation and adaptation of climate change, multiple approaches for impact assessment, intensity prediction and adaptation have been advanced in the Kenyan tea sub-sector. Further, pressure on tea breeders to release improved climate-compatible cultivars for the rapidly deteriorating environment has resulted in the adoption of a multi-targeted approach seeking to understand the complex molecular regulatory networks associated with biotic and abiotic stresses adaptation and tolerance in tea. Genetic modeling, a powerful tool that assists in breeding process, has also been adopted for selection of tea cultivars for optimal performance under varying climatic conditions. A range of physiological and biochemical responses known to counteract the effects of environmental stresses in most plants that include lowering the rates of cellular growth and net photosynthesis, stomatal closure, and the accumulation of organic solutes such as sugar alcohols, or osmolytes have been used to support breeding programs through screening of new tea cultivars suitable for changing environment. This review describes simulation models combined with high resolution climate change scenarios required to quantify the relative importance of climate change on tea production. In addition, both biodiversity and ecosystem based approaches are described as a part of an overall adaptation strategy to mitigate adverse effects of climate change on tea in Kenya and gaps highlighted for urgent investigations.","Camellia, modeling, breeding, molecular, physiology ",0.0

A case study in semi-arid region of Brazil,"Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is a family of decision-making tools that can be used in strategic environmental assessment (SEA) procedures to ensure that environmental, social and economic aspects are integrated into the design of human development strategies and planning, in order to increase the contribution of the environment and natural resources to poverty reduction. The aim of this paper is to highlight the contribution of a particular multi-criteria technique, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), in two stages of the SEA procedure applied to water programmes in developing countries: the comparison of alternatives and monitoring. This proposal was validated through its application to a case study in Brazilian semi-arid region. The objective was to select and subsequently monitor the most appropriate programme for safe water availability. On the basis of the SEA results, a project was identified and implemented with successful results. In terms of comparisons of alternatives, AHP meets the requirements of human development programme assessment, including the importance of simplicity, a multidisciplinary and flexible approach, and a focus on the beneficiaries’ concerns. With respect to monitoring, the study shows that AHP contributes to SEA by identifying the most appropriate indicators, in order to control the impacts of a project.", ,1.0
146,Challenging dominant discourses of climate change,"The influence of language on communication about climate change is well
recognised, but this understanding is under-utilised by those seeking to increase uptake of
action for climate change. We discuss the terms, discourse, resistance, and agency, to assist in
developing ways to progress social action for climate change. Using a review of academic
literature about climate change, we explore three of the many dominant discourses that
constrain action: the logical action discourse; the complexity discourse; and the culture of
consumption discourse. While there are more discourses about climate change, especially in
the popular literature, the ways these three operate in the peri-scientific sphere is underrecognised.
We suggest that by examining the different framings of climate change, there is
potential to create novel discourses and to start new processes of societal response. This paper

147,Compensating for lost nature values through biodiversity offsetting – Where is the evidence?,"Biodiversity offsetting is becoming a principal instrument for managing biodiversity and ecosystem services in society. Still, it is unclear whether biodiversity offsetting can fully mitigate losses to natural values. When reviewing published studies on offsetting, we found only 40 evaluations with primary outcome data on biodiversity or ecosystem services. Among these, we found no evidence that biodiversity gains from offsets actually compensate for development-associated losses, because losses were never estimated. The failure to quantify losses is troubling from a conservation perspective, as applying offsets that do not match up losses and gains will result in continued net loss of biodiversity. Instead, most studies (76%) included only reference habitats as comparator and evaluated singular taxa of biodiversity (66%), and rarely ecosystem services (ES). The overall meta-analysed effect size from reference habitat comparisons suggests that offsets perform poorly when contrasted to these habitats. There was a strong bias towards North American freshwater biomes, with only six published evaluations from terrestrial habitats. The bias and small number of studies precluded any detailed meta-analytical enquiries, such as identification of main drivers of outcomes. For biodiversity offsetting to be an important instrument for halting biodiversity losses, all actions must build on solid scientific evidence, and our review show that this evidence base is yet not in place. We conclude that there is a strong need for rigorous evaluation of offsetting projects, and to this end governments could request long-term monitoring programmes as an integral part of offsetting actions and make data openly available for assessment.",Biodiversity offsettingNo net lossEcosystem servicesHabitatSpecies richnessEcological compensationEvaluationMeta-analysis ,1.0

quantitative spatial assessment in British Columbia, Canada","Ecosystem-based approaches to fisheries management to date have lacked a quantitative spatial un-
derstanding of habitat impacts from fishing. Understanding such ecological impacts in part requires
knowledge of benthic structure and sensitivity. We compared two approaches to calculate and map
spatially explicit habitat impacts for twelve different fisheries in 21 broad benthic classes in Canada's
Pacific. By fishery, bottom trawling had the highest sum impact score across benthic classes, and bottom
trawl and bottom longline generally scored highest per unit area. Soft shelf, which was the most
extensively fished benthic class (33,373 km2 of a total 454,183 km2 study area), had the highest cu-
mulative impact score, followed by the slope benthic classes (16,315 km2). Canyons and slope benthic
classes had the highest impact scores per unit area. We recommend our approach as one that facilitates a
regional understanding of benthic habitat impact by individual fisheries, as well as of cumulative impact
for all bottom and demersal fishing activities. This assessment also highlights the regional paucity of
habitat data required for more detailed analyses. Such habitat impact assessments have utility in

(2) action proponent; (3) preparer; (4) review agency; (5) rule-setting agency; (6)
concerned agencies; (7) general public; and (8) licensing agency. Five types of
performance outcome are suggested that may follow the introduction of E1A into
a national planning system. These include EIA as (1) a fully internalized element
of the planning process, (2) a support for a position of advocacy for the environment,
(3) a process of adjustment among conflicting goals, (4) a process to remedy
prior environmental damage, and (5) a perfunctory endorsement of public or private
actions. Using these categories, the E1A system of the Philippines, Korea, and
Brazil are analyzed. Three aspects of ElA implementation are compared: national
development planning and environmental goals; institutional structure; and performance
evaluation. Based on this analysis, the author concludes that while E1A
in developing countries is being hampered in its early stages by institutional factors,
there are some specific policies that, if adopted by national governments and
international aid agencies, would enhance the integration of EIA into the planning

The  land-use  and  habitats  predicted  under  each  scenario  were  assessed  using  seven  methods  of
determining  value,  namely:  Ecological  Impact  Assessment  method,  reserve-selection  criteria,
target-based criteria, stakeholder-choice analysis, reserve-selection criteria guided by stakeholders,
agri-environment scheme payments and contingent valuation. The first three methods derive values
based on pre-defined priorities, the next two use stated preferences of  stakeholders, and the last two
methods derive monetary values based on revealed and expressed preference, respectively.

making, ecologists are increasingly called upon to value the biodiversity of  a site or to compare the
value of  different sites. This study has shown that seven different valuation methods, although all
giving significantly correlated findings, resulted in seven different rankings of  nature-conservation
value for the 25 situations studied. This difference occurred in spite of  the sites being of  the same
landscape type and occurring within the same country. The discussion concludes that each method
has its strengths; monetary valuations are appropriate in some contexts, stakeholder preferences are
paramount in others, but where objectivity is key, then assessment against independently defined

seasonal drift, cold wave and heat wave) and non-climatic (river erosion, repetitive death of field

and a decreasing trend of total annual rainfall from 1981 to 2015, which have been supported by
people’s perception. This study found that river erosion, the increase of temperature and the late
arrival of monsoon rain, excessive monsoon rainfall, high use of agrochemicals, and flow alterations
are major drivers in the riverine ecosystem. These drivers are creating pressures on agricultural land,
soil fertility, water availability and livelihood patterns of affected communities. Hence, floating bed
cultivation, integrated pest management, use of cover crops, reforestation, the introduction of

policy enforcement. However, few studies have evaluated how such sanctions are implemented,
particularly in the context of environmental impact assessments (EIA) and their respective follow-up
programs. The main objective of this article was to evaluate how administrative sanctions have been
used in EIA follow-ups, using the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais as the empirical context. More specifically
it tried to understand what have been the main triggers, frequency, nature and financial values of
the sanctions issued to noncompliant mining projects operating under the conditions of environmental
licenses. First, through literature reviews, the study characterized the institutional and regulatory
framework in which administrative sanctions are applied. Content analyzes of 29 infraction processes
further revealed that lump sum fines are the preferred option of administrative sanction in EIA followups.
The analysis also revealed that the fines could be perceived as disproportionally small if one considers
the size and financial power of non-compliant companies. The great majority of the fines were
paid by developers: a fact that contradicts previous empirical findings and anecdotal evidence in Brazil.
Overall, the study suggests that the impact of administrative sanctions in corporate behavior, while
unclear, is likely small. The study concludes by discussing practical and academic implications.","Environmental policy enforcement

Seasonal atmospheric variations were analyzed using the HotSpot Health Physics Code to model the Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE) distribution following an explosion. The TEDE's effect on different human organs was assessed, considering both external and internal radiation exposures. The study demonstrated that winter nights posed the highest radiation risk, with dose distribution areas of 0.018 km<sup>2</sup>, 0.14 km<sup>2</sup>, and 3.3 km<sup>2</sup> for inner, middle, and outer zones, respectively, surpassing other seasonal and daily values. Conversely, summer recorded the lowest radiation spread. A detailed temporal analysis during winter nights showed an initial TEDE of 9.5 Sv at 0.1 min post-explosion, which decreased exponentially to 1.3 Sv after 2000 min (33.3 h) and further to 0.0038 Sv after 6500 min (108.3 h) with the aid of AI-enhanced “Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM)”. The highest radiation doses to human organs within a 100 m2 area during the initial 10 min post-detonation were significantly above permissible limits, with critical organs like the surface bone, liver, and red marrow receiving doses of 68 Sv, 12 Sv, and 5.5 Sv, respectively. These findings underline the need for robust emergency response strategies and long-term health monitoring to mitigate the adverse health impacts of RDDs.

163,Enhanced well-being assessment as basis for the practical implementation of ethical and rights-based normative principles for AI,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) has an increasing impact on all areas of people's livelihoods. A detailed look at existing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary metrics frameworks could bring new insights and enable practitioners to navigate the challenge of understanding and assessing the impact of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems (A/IS). There has been emerging consensus on fundamental ethical and rights-based AI principles proposed by scholars, governments, civil rights organizations, and technology companies. In order to move from principles to real-world implementation, we adopt a lens motivated by regulatory impact assessments and the well-being movement in public policy. Similar to public policy interventions, outcomes of AI systems implementation may have far-reaching complex impacts. In public policy, indicators are only part of a broader toolbox, as metrics inherently lead to gaming and dissolution of incentives and objectives. Similarly, in the case of A/IS, there's a need for a larger toolbox that allows for the iterative assessment of identified impacts, inclusion of new impacts in the analysis, and identification of emerging trade-offs. In this paper, we propose the practical application of an enhanced well-being impact assessment framework for A/IS that could be employed to address ethical and rights-based normative principles in AI. This process could enable a human-centered algorithmically-supported approach to the understanding of the impacts of AI systems. Finally, we propose a new testing infrastructure which would allow for governments, civil rights organizations, and others, to engage in cooperating with A/IS developers towards implementation of enhanced well-being impact assessments.",,0.0

A comprehensive literature review is urgently needed to support green design efficiently and comprehensively in view of the complexity of the product design information and the diversity of green design methods. Therefore, this paper focuses on the four key aspects of product green design, i.e., modeling, assessment, optimization, and tools, which systematically investigates the literature and analyzes the characteristics, application, and mutual problem of the methods. Based on this, conclusions for the future research directions of product green design were drawn from the following aspects: (1) the life cycle integrated model considering the complex mapping association mechanism, (2) the inventory data acquisition strategy for life cycle environmental impact assessment, (3) the life cycle optimization on the basis of the artificial intelligence, and (4) the integrated tool of green design.","['Green design ', ' Green design tools ', ' Life cycle assessment ', ' Modeling for green design ', ' Optimization for green design']",0.0

166,Operationalizing Digitainability: Encouraging Mindfulness to Harness the Power of Digitalization for Sustainable Development,"Digitalization is globally transforming the world with profound implications. It has enormous potential to foster progress toward sustainability. However, in its current form, digitalization also continues to enable and encourage practices with numerous unsustainable impacts affecting our environment, ingraining inequality, and degrading quality of life. There is an urgent need to identify such multifaceted impacts holistically. Impact assessment of digital interventions (DIs) leading to digitalization is essential specifically for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Action is required to understand the pursuit of short-term gains toward achieving long-term value-driven sustainable development. We need to understand the impact of DIs on various actors and in diverse contexts. A holistic understanding of the impact will help us align the visions of sustainable development and identify potential measures to mitigate negative short and long-term impacts. The recently developed digitainability assessment framework (DAF) unveils the impact of DIs with an in-depth context-aware assessment and offers an evidence-based impact profile of SDGs at the indicator level. This paper demonstrates how DAF can be instrumental in guiding participatory action for the implementation of digitainability practices. This paper summarizes the insights developed during the Digitainable Spring School 2022 (DSS) on “Sustainability with Digitalization and Artificial Intelligence,” one of whose goals was to operationalize the DAF as a tool in the participatory action process with collaboration and active involvement of diverse professionals in the field of digitalization and sustainability. The DAF guides a holistic context-aware process formulation for a given DI. An evidence-based evaluation within the DAF protocol benchmarks a specific DI’s impact against the SDG indicators framework. The participating experts worked together to identify a DI and gather and analyze evidence by operationalizing the DAF. The four DIs identified in the process are as follows: smart home technology (SHT) for energy efficiency, the blockchain for food security, artificial intelligence (AI) for land use and cover change (LUCC), and Big Data for international law. Each of the four expert groups addresses different DIs for digitainability assessment using different techniques to gather and analyze data related to the criteria and indicators. The knowledge presented here could increase understanding of the challenges and opportunities related to digitainability and provide a structure for developing and implementing robust digitainability practices with data-driven insights.","['Agenda 2030 ', ' artificial intelligence ', ' Big Data ', ' blockchain ', ' digitainability ', ' digital age ', ' digitalization ', ' SDGs ', ' smart homes ', ' sustainability ', ' sustainable development ', ' technology assessment framework']",1.0

168,Bridging the Regulatory Divide: A Dual-Pathway Framework Using SRA Approvals and AI Evaluation to Ensure Drug Quality in Developing Countries,"Background: Developing countries face significant challenges in accessing high-quality pharmaceutical products due to resource constraints, limited regulatory capacity, and market dynamics that often prioritize cost over quality. This review addresses the critical gap in regulatory frameworks that fail to ensure pharmaceutical quality equity between developed and developing nations. Objective: This comprehensive review examines a novel dual-pathway regulatory framework that leverages stringent regulatory authority (SRA) approvals, artificial intelligence-based evaluation systems, and harmonized pricing mechanisms to ensure pharmaceutical quality equity across global markets. Methods: A comprehensive systematic analysis of current regulatory challenges, proposed solutions, and implementation strategies was conducted through an extensive literature review (202 sources, 2019–2025), expert consultation on regulatory science, AI implementation in healthcare, and pharmaceutical policy development. The methodology included an analysis of regulatory precedents, an economic impact assessment, and a feasibility evaluation based on existing technological implementations. Results: The proposed framework addresses key regulatory capacity gaps through two complementary pathways: Pathway 1 enables same-batch distribution from SRA-approved products with pricing parity mechanisms. At the same time, Pathway 2 provides independent evaluation using AI-enhanced systems for differentiated products. Key components include indigenous AI development, which requires systematic implementation over 4–6 years across three distinct stages, outsourced auditing frameworks that reduce costs by 40–50%, and quality-first principles that categorically reject cost-based quality compromises. Implementation analysis demonstrates a potential for achieving a 90–95% quality standardization, accompanied by a 200–300% increase in regulatory evaluation capability. Conclusions: This framework has the potential to significantly improve pharmaceutical quality and access in developing countries while maintaining rigorous safety and efficacy standards through innovative regulatory approaches. The evidence demonstrates substantial public health benefits with projected improvements in population access (85–95% coverage), treatment success rates (90–95% efficacy), and economic benefits (USD 15–30 billion in system efficiencies), providing a compelling case for implementation that aligns with global scientific consensus and Sustainable Development Goal 3.8.","['artificial intelligence ', ' developing countries ', ' drug quality ', ' pharmaceutical regulation ', ' quality assurance ', ' regulatory harmonization ', ' SRA reliance']",0.0

The marine economy, as an important part of economic development, is the breakthrough of economic transformation for many coastal countries. Additionally, green development and environmental impact assessment have become the focus of research in these countries. This study employs remote sensing technology, an efficient observational method, to significantly enhance the efficiency of ocean information observation. It investigates ocean carbon emissions within the framework of carbon neutrality. First, we identified the ships along the coastline based on marine remote sensing information through the YOLO (you only look once) framework. Second, we applied the LSTM (long short-term memory) method to combine the target identification results and the historical data of carbon emissions to complete the corresponding carbon emission data fitting. Finally, carbon emission data from the past three years in the offshore area of Dalian were used to make accurate predictions. The results suggested that the recognition rate of the proposed target detection method could reach 88%, and the LSTM method has shown the best performance in terms of absolute error for the subsequent short-term carbon emission prediction.

These photos, associated with their geographic locations, can provide free, timely, and reliable visual information about flood events to the decision-makers. This screening system, designed for application to social media images, includes several key modules: tweet/image downloading, flooding photo detection, and a WebGIS application for human verification. In this study, a training dataset of 4800 flooding photos was built based on an iterative method using a convolutional neural network (CNN) developed and trained to detect flooding photos. The system was designed in a way that the CNN can be re-trained by a larger training dataset when more analyst-verified flooding photos are being added to the training set in an iterative manner. The total accuracy of flooding photo detection was 93% in a balanced test set, and the precision ranges from 46-63% in the highly imbalanced real-time tweets. The system is plug-in enabled, permitting flexible changes to the classification module.

174,Developing long short-term memory combined with numerical first order differential optimization and clockwork recurrent neural network to predict suspended sediment load,"The analysis of aquatic ecosystems heavily relies on the parameter of suspended sediment load (SSL) in rivers, which affects the chemical and biological compositions of water. This is crucial for decision-making in water resource management and environmental conservation. This study aims to predict SSL in the Missouri and Mississippi rivers using daily SSL and discharge (Q) data from the Nebraska City (NC) and Below Grafton (BG) stations (1999–2017). We introduce an innovative strategy leveraging artificial intelligence techniques like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN), Random Forest (RF), and Clockwork Recurrent Neural Network (CWRNN) to enhance SSL forecasting. The integration of the first-order difference (DIFF) refines the input data, heightening sensitivity to temporal sediment variations. Models’ precision was assessed using correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), relative absolute error (RAE), Bias Factor (BF), and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE). Sensitivity analysis with Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) indicated SSLt-1 as the key parameter. The hybrid models, notably DIFF-CWRNN-LSTM, DIFF-FFNN-LSTM, and DIFF-RF-LSTM, displayed superior performance, with the DIFF-CWRNN-LSTM model exhibiting the highest accuracy: CC of 0.922 and 0.968, KGE of 0.980 and 0.995 for NC and BG stations, respectively. This novel approach consistently predicts SSL under varying conditions, marking it as a reliable and recommended model. The enhanced model effectively predicts SSL peak values, addressing a historical research gap, thus improving its applicability in environmental and hydrological impact assessments.","['Clockwork recurrent neural network ', ' Mississippi river ', ' Missouri river ', ' Optimization methods ', ' Shapley additive explanation ', ' Suspended sediment load']",1.0

176,Urban Traffic State Sensing and Analysis Based on ETC Data: A Survey,"Urban traffic management faces challenges, including inadequate sensing capabilities and insufficient operational status evaluation. The rapid expansion of electronic toll collection (ETC) systems from highways to urban roads provides new opportunities to address these issues. The vast amount of “dormant” ETC data contains rich traffic information that urgently needs to be deeply mined and effectively utilized. This paper reviews the research status, key technologies, and development trends of urban traffic state sensing and analysis technologies based on ETC data. In terms of technological development, ETC systems have evolved from simple toll collection tools to comprehensive traffic management platforms, featuring unique advantages such as accurate vehicle identification, extensive spatiotemporal coverage, and stable data quality. ETC data-based traffic sensing technologies encompass traffic state representation at microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic levels, enabling comprehensive sensing from individual vehicle behavior to overall network operations. The construction of multi-source data fusion frameworks enables effective complementarity between ETC data, floating car data, and video detection data, significantly improving traffic state estimation accuracy. In practical applications, ETC data has demonstrated enormous potential in real-time monitoring and signal control optimization, traffic prediction and artificial intelligence technologies, environmental impact assessment, and other fields. Meanwhile, ETC data-based urban traffic management is transitioning from passive responses to proactive prediction, from single functions to comprehensive services, and from isolated systems to integrated platforms. Looking toward the future, the deep integration of emerging technologies, such as vehicle–road networking, edge computing, and artificial intelligence, with ETC systems will further promote the intelligent, refined, and precise development of urban traffic management.","['electronic toll collection ', ' intelligent transportation systems ', ' multi-source data fusion ', ' traffic state sensing ', ' urban traffic management']",0.0

While these simulations can be accurate, they are computationally expensive and prohibitively so when thinking about real-time prediction based on dynamic environmental conditions. Alternatively, social media platforms such as Twitter are often used by people to communicate during a flooding event, but discovering which tweets hold useful information is the key challenge in extracting information from posts in real time.

185,Plant drought impact detection using ultra-high spatial resolution hyperspectral images and machine learning,"Early drought stress detection is crucial for restoring productivity, ensuring recovery, and providing vital information for mortality prevention. Hyperspectral remote sensing which is sensitive to subtle changes in leaf constituents and canopy structure is widely used to study how drought stress manifests and evolves over time. Drought impacts are complicated, affecting multiple leaf properties at different stages of severity. Spectral indices are widely used for stress monitoring, given their sensitivity to one or more plant biochemical, biophysical, and structural properties. However, appropriate spectral bands are not always apparent for early drought detection and stress progression monitoring since drought response varies by species, from tolerators to competitors. A tolerator can produce secondary compounds to enhance leaf survival while a competitor allows stressed leaves to perish so that new growth can occur. Also, spectral indices typically utilize a few bands and therefore do not exploit information in other spectral regions that are also influenced by drought. With the development of machine learning and increased computational power, the use of full spectra and derivative spectra becomes possible, holding great potential to offer new insights into the drought impacts. In this study, full spectra and derivative spectra were integrated with advanced machine learning algorithms for early drought detection and classification. The results from these models were compared to those from traditional spectral index-based methods. The models were tested using drought-stressed smooth brome (Bromus inermis) grass grown in a chamber with 0% and 25% field precipitation, using close-range hyperspectral images. The results showed that the use of derivative spectra and the deep learning model allowed accurate drought detection with an overall accuracy of up to 97.5% and 100% while spectral indices and spectral index models either failed to detect early stress or could detect early stress but with much lower accuracy. This study demonstrated the usefulness of integrating deep learning and hyperspectral data in plant stress research for stress impact assessment, recovery, and mitigation.","['Drought classification ', ' Early stress detection ', ' Multilayer Perceptron ', ' Random Forest ', ' Spectral derivative ', ' Support Vector Machine']",1.0

187,The Ethical Impact Assessment of Selling Life Insurance to Titanic Passengers,"The Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) is a uniform legal framework to ensure that AI systems within the European Union (EU) are safe and comply with existing law on fundamental rights and constitutional values. The AIA adopts a risk-based approach with the aim of intending to regulate AI systems, especially categorised as high-risk, which have significant harmful impacts on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the Union. The AIA is founded on the Ethics Guidelines of the High-Level Expert Group for Trustworthy AI, which are grounded in fundamental rights and reflect four ethical imperatives in order to ensure ethical and robust AI. While we acknowledge that ethics is not law, we advocate that the analysis of ethical risks can assist us in complying with laws, thereby facilitating the implementation of the AIA requirements. Thus, we first design an AI-driven Decision Support System for individual risk prediction in the insurance domain (categorised as high-risk by the AIA) based on the Titanic case, which is a popular benchmark dataset in machine learning. We then fulfill an ethical impact assessment of the Titanic case study, relying on the four ethical imperatives of respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, fairness, and explicability, declared by the High-Level Expert Group for Trustworthy AI. In the context of this ethical impact assessment, we also refer to the questions in the ALTAI checklist. Our discussions regarding the ethical impact assessment in the insurance domain demonstrate that ethical principles can intersect but also create tensions (intriguingly, only in this particular context), for which there is no definitive solution. When tensions arise, which may result in unavoidable trade-offs, these trade-offs should be addressed in a rational and methodical manner, paying special attention to the context of the current case study being evaluated.",,0.0

Although the broad economic impact of digital health solutions in general has been assessed many times in literature and the benefit for patients and society has also been analyzed, the specific economic impact of AI in health care has been addressed only sporadically. Objective: This study aimed to systematically review and summarize the cost-effectiveness studies dedicated to AI in health care and to assess whether they meet the established quality criteria. Methods: In a first step, the quality criteria for economic impact studies were defined based on the established and adapted criteria schemes for cost impact assessments. In a second step, a systematic literature review based on qualitative and quantitative inclusion and exclusion criteria was conducted to identify relevant publications for an in-depth analysis of the economic impact assessment. In a final step, the quality of the identified economic impact studies was evaluated based on the defined quality criteria for cost-effectiveness studies. Results: Very few publications have thoroughly addressed the economic impact assessment, and the economic assessment quality of the reviewed publications on AI shows severe methodological deficits. Only 6 out of 66 publications could be included in the second step of the analysis based on the inclusion criteria. Out of these 6 studies, none comprised a methodologically complete cost impact analysis. There are two areas for improvement in future studies. First, the initial investment and operational costs for the AI infrastructure and service need to be included. Second, alternatives to achieve similar impact must be evaluated to provide a comprehensive comparison. Conclusions: This systematic literature analysis proved that the existing impact assessments show methodological deficits and that upcoming evaluations require more comprehensive economic analyses to enable economic decisions for or against implementing AI technology in health care.","['Artificial intelligence ', ' Cost-benefit analysis ', ' Machine learning ', ' Telemedicine']",0.0
189,Deep learning-based pm forecasting and post-infant mortality assessment in urban areas: a case study in Bangladesh,"This study investigated the application of advanced deep learning models for forecasting particulate matter (PM) pollution and assessing its associated health impacts in Bangladesh. Specifically, the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), Deep Autoregressive Recurrent Neural Network (DeepAR), Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) were employed to forecast daily PM concentrations for the next seven days across four urban areas (Chattogram, Rajshahi, Dhaka, and Sylhet) during 2013–2018. The study further quantified post-infant mortality risks attributable to PM<inf>10</inf> exposure in these regions. Model performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Coefficient of Determination (R²), and Index of Agreement (IOA). TFT demonstrated superior capability, achieving mean RMSEs of 21.23 µg/m<sup>3</sup> (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) and 34.90 µg/m<sup>3</sup> (PM<inf>10</inf>), outperforming DeepAR by 39% and 40.6%, respectively, and surpassing 1D-CNN and GAN. The attention mechanism in TFT revealed distinct temporal dynamics, with PM<inf>2.5</inf> prediction dominated by temperature and relative humidity indicating inversion-driven accumulation, while PM<inf>10</inf> forecasting emphasized wind speed, rainfall, and relative humidity aligning with Bangladesh’s monsoon-driven dispersion and dust resuspension. Health risk analysis, conducted using the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Air Quality Health Impact Assessment Tool (AirQ+), revealed significant post-infant mortality impacts, with the highest attributable mortality per 1000 population observed in Dhaka (42.95%) and Sylhet (24.64%). The strong agreement between observed and forecasted health outcomes validated the reliability of the TFT model.","['Deep learning ', ' Health impacts ', ' Infant mortality ', ' Particulate matter ', ' PM forecasting ', ' Public health']",1.0
190,Health effects of power plant emissions through ambient air quality,"Coal burning power plants are a frequent target of regulatory programmes because of their emission of chemicals that are known precursors to the formation of ambient particulate air pollution. Health impact assessments of emissions from coal power plants typically rely on assumed causal relationships between emissions, ambient pollution and health, many of which have never been empirically verified. We offer a novel statistical evaluation of some of these presumed causal relationships, integrating the formality of causal inference methods with repurposed tools from atmospheric science to accommodate the central challenge of long-range pollution transport of emissions from power plants to exposed populations. The statistical approach follows recent work on Bayesian methods for deploying principal stratification and causal mediation analysis in tandem to characterize the extent to which decreased sulphur dioxide emissions from 410 power plants across the USA impact mortality and hospitalization outcomes across Medicare beneficiaries residing across 12370 locations in a manner that is mediated through reductions of ambient fine particulate pollution. The result is the first epidemiological investigation integrating causal inference methodology with direct measurements of coal emissions, pollution transport, ambient pollution and human health in a single analysis, indicating the potential for data science at the intersection of statistics, epidemiology and atmospheric science.","['Bayesian causal inference ', ' Health effects ', ' Sulphur dioxide emissions']",1.0
191,"Design and development of a generic spatial decision support system, based on artificial intelligence and multicriteria decision analysis","A new integrated and generic Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) is presented based on a combination of Artificial Intelligence and Multicriteria Decision Analysis techniques. The approach proposed is developed to address commonly faced spatial decision problems of site selection, site ranking, impact assessment and spatial knowledge discovery under one system. The site selection module utilises a theme-based Analytical Hierarchy Process. Two novel site ranking techniques are introduced. The first is based on a systematic neighbourhood comparison of sites with respect to key datasets (criterions). The second utilises multivariate ordering capability of one-dimensional Self-Organizing Maps. The site impact assessment module utilises a new spatially enabled Rapid Impact Assessment Matrix. A spatial variant of General Regression Neural Networks is developed for Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and prediction analysis. The developed system is proposed as a useful modern tool that facilitates quantitative and evidence based decision making in multicriteria decision environment. The intended users of the system are decision makers in government organisations, in particular those involved in planning and development when taking into account socio-economic, environmental and public health related issues.","['Analytical hierarchy process ', ' General regression neural networks ', ' Rapid impact assessment matrix ', ' Self-organizing maps ', ' Site impact assessment ', ' Site selection']",1.0
192,Application of systems thinking and system dynamics in managing risks and stakeholders in construction projects: A systematic literature review,"This paper conducts a systematic literature review on systems thinking (ST) and system dynamics (SD) applications in construction project risk and stakeholder management over the past decade. It evaluates current practices' alignment with SD, addressing project complexity and uncertainty. Seventy-three articles are analysed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, using descriptive, thematic and bibliometric analyses. Findings show fluctuating trends in ST and SD applications due to COVID-19 in 2019, with notable contributions from China, Australia and the UK. Building projects are the most studied, employing mixed methodologies. Thematic analysis highlights SD's significant role in system representation and risk management, with 80% of studies utilizing SD models for various risk factors. While less common in stakeholder management, SD enhances communication and understanding of stakeholder dynamics. The study advocates for integrating SD modelling in construction management for improved decision-making, risk mitigation and stakeholder engagement for project management practitioners, urging collaboration between academia, industry and policymakers for effective construction policies. Academics and researchers should focus on standardizing SD modelling tools, exploring hybrid methodologies like agent-based modelling, and integrating emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance real-time decision-making capabilities. Collaboration between academia, industry practitioners and policymakers is crucial to ensure SD research translates into effective policies and best practices, particularly in safety and environmental impact assessments.","['construction projects ', ' risk management ', ' stakeholder management ', ' system dynamics ', ' systematic literature review ', ' systems thinking']",0.0
193,Digital environmental impact assessment: An exploration of emerging digital approaches for non-technical reports,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a tool for providing systematic assessment to identify environmental, social, and economic impacts of significant developments. Through a series of technical assessments, public-facing reports are produced, including non-technical summaries of larger reports- these documents communicate assessment outcomes to non-technical public stakeholders during consultation. Consultation approaches have stagnated and achieve minimal feedback with a notable age-bias based on low turn-outs at consultation events. Digital technology is being promoted to create a widely accessible, engaging, information source to aid public knowledge and awareness of EIA outcomes. In recent years, progressive digital reporting approaches such as Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI) StoryMaps, purpose-built web-solutions and bespoke-built websites, have been adopted by environmental and engineering consultancies to digitalise EIA public-facing reports. The 1998 Aarhus Convention sets out fundamental requirements for public participation within environmental decision-making, requiring inclusivity, accessibility and transparency. Consultation phases are increasingly utilising digitalised reports for their non-technical stakeholder audience, and therefore need to fulfil Aarhus requirements. This study explored the usability of digitalised public-facing documents. Interactive digital reports intended for a non-technical audience, using the interface formats ESRI StoryMaps, purpose-built web solutions and bespoke websites, were focused on due to their increasing use within public EIS reporting in engineering and environmental consultancies operating globally. Three research approaches were employed: a usability test of a purpose-built interactive digital document, interviews with digital EIA practitioners and a comparative cartographic and interface feature review. We found evidence of a digital divide between age groups and ability to effectively utilise a precedent digital report- with older users (aged 66+) less able to access information and avoid errors. Digital literacy on its own was not a reliable indicator of a user's ability to navigate a digital environment but is likely compounded by other factors such as cognitive function among older users. Practitioners saw opportunities in digitalised reports but recognised limitations in their value to some users. Current digital reporting practice presents initial usability issues, indicating direction for essential development towards a receptor-based, personalised, report.","['Consultation ', ' Digital inclusion ', ' Digital literacy ', ' Public engagement ', ' Public Participatory Geographical Information Systems (PPGIS) ', ' StoryMaps ', ' Usability test']",1.0
194,INSIGHT: An integrated framework for safe and sustainable chemical and material assessment,"The assessment of chemicals and materials has traditionally been fragmented, with health, environmental, social, and economic impacts evaluated independently. This disjointed approach limits the ability to capture trade-offs and synergies necessary for comprehensive decision-making under the Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) framework. The EU INSIGHT project addresses this challenge by developing a novel computational framework for integrated impact assessment, based on the Impact Outcome Pathway (IOP) approach. Extending the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) concept, IOPs establish mechanistic links between chemical and material properties and their environmental, health, and socio-economic consequences. The project integrates multi-source datasets (including omics, life cycle inventories, and exposure models) into a structured knowledge graph (KG), ensuring FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles are met. INSIGHT is being developed and validated through four case studies targeting per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), graphene oxide (GO), bio-based synthetic amorphous silica (SAS), and antimicrobial coatings. These studies demonstrate how multi-model simulations, decision-support tools, and artificial intelligence-driven knowledge extraction can enhance the predictability and interpretability of chemical and material impacts. Additionally, INSIGHT incorporates interactive, web-based decision maps to provide stakeholders with accessible, regulatory-compliant risk and sustainability assessments. By bridging mechanistic toxicology, exposure modeling, life cycle assessment, and socio-economic analysis, INSIGHT advances a scalable, transparent, and data-driven approach to SSbD. This project aligns with the European Green Deal and global sustainability goals, promoting safer, more sustainable innovation in chemicals and materials through an integrated, mechanistic, and computationally advanced framework.","['Chemical and material risk assessment ', ' FAIR principles ', ' Impact outcome pathway (IOP) ', ' Non-animal or new approach methods (NAMs) ', ' Safe and sustainable by design (SSbD)']",1.0
195,What would environmental impact assessment look like if we started from scratch today? Designing better EIA for developed neoliberal nations,"After more than five decades of practice, environmental impact assessment (EIA) has failed to convince sceptics that it represents value for money. It increasingly overlaps with constantly emerging sustainability requirements. The completed assessments are extremely long, exceed the cognitive capacities of decision makers to assimilate information, cannot address motivated reasoning, and therefore inevitably lead to trade-offs that threaten the very environmental components EIA was designed to protect. In this paper, for the minority of nations with highly developed existing environmental legislation and management only, we propose three radical approaches that include: (1) the adoption of ‘satisficing’, to deliver a streamlined assessment that is good enough; underpinned by (2) better application of ‘acceptable harmrules’ embedded in existing environmental legislation in many jurisdictions to prevent significant harm to environmental media; and (3) an ‘externalities charge’ on developers (irrespective of whether EIA is required) to force more aggressive scoping through market incentives and to fund a shift towards adaptive environmental assessment and management that manages environmental outcomes. Better environmental protections could be delivered using a far more streamlined EIA process, associated with the creation and maintenance of more accurate and comprehensive datasets that can provide better evidence for emerging artificial intelligence tools.","['Environmental impact assessment ', ' externality tax ', ' futures thinking ', ' neoliberalism ', ' satisficing ', ' scoping']",1.0

199,How to Assess Digitisation Impacts on the Food Industry: The Dutch Case of Microdata Collection for Firms’ Sustainability,"Digital innovations can increase resilience and sustainability of food businesses due to for instance increasing efficiency, reducing pollution or improving transparency about production conditions. However, much of the research on this topic has been done at the primary production level, i.e. on technology impacts on farms, or remains at an ex-ante case study level when looking at digital technology impacts in downstream food businesses. Therefore, ex-post impacts of digital technologies after their adoption are largely unknown. We here argue that this knowledge gap arises from the fact that we lack single company data (i.e. micro-data) on the adoption of digital technologies in food businesses. Only with this information can actual impacts of these technologies be assessed using causal inference methods. As a way forward, we highlight a unique dataset of digital technology adoption among Dutch downstream food businesses that is available for research purposes. We show that digital technologies already have a considerable market penetration in the Netherlands. Therefore, we urge the scientific community and governmental statistical offices to collect and make available similar data globally and make use of the already existing data. Such impact assessments will inform and accelerate the transition towards more sustainable and resilient food value chains.",,0.0
200,Research of the HSPF model on nonpoint source pollution modeling and management: progresses and perspectives,"Non-point source (NPS) pollution has become a major threat to watershed environment and security in recent decades. The occurrence and transport of NPS pollution include several dynamic processes which are characterized by randomness, complexity, uncertainty, etc. Existing monitoring network is not sufficient to accurately evaluate the contribution of NPS pollution and understand the underlying mechanisms. Efficient and sound assessment tools are needed to facilitate preventing and controlling NPS pollution. Nowadays many watershed models become increasingly popular to simulate, predict, and analyze NPS pollution processes and assist in decision makings for integrated watershed management. HSPF (Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN) is one of the most comprehensive and flexible NPS models around the world. It has been developed and maintained mainly by the U.S. Environment Protection Agency and is highly recommended in flood-control planning and operations, water quality planning and management, conservation practices evaluation, etc. The HSPF model conceptualizes a watershed system into surface, soil, and stream segments to simulate the continuous, storm event, or steady-state behavior of both hydrologic and water quality processes in natural or manmade water systems. The model has proven its ability to be used with reasonable accuracy in diverse hydrologic regimes, which leads to its broad application worldwide. The research and practice of the HSPF model applied to watersheds in China have expanded rapidly in recent years, but the model is also facing challenges in terms of localization for model theory and parameters, refinement during the model setup process, and uncertainty embedded in the simulated results. Therefore, this paper focused on the research progress of the HSPF model in NPS pollution modeling and control by reviewing existing relative papers. The conceptualization principles of the HSPF model to simulate NPS pollution was first described. This was followed by extensive reviews of the modeling methods and application in changing environment, as well as the ideas and methods for parameter identification, uncertainty analysis, control measures evaluation and total emission control. The extended development of HSPF model under the modern environmental modeling situation was also summarized. PyHSPF and HSP<sup>2</sup>as two representatives were specifically discussed in their improvement in compiling environment, data management, dynamic representation of watershed properties, parallel computing, and Application Program Interface. The suggested developments in future studies include: localization model improvement for China's watershed characteristics, large-scale refinement modeling to cope with the fine regulatory services of the river chief system, coupling with big data statistics and artificial intelligence for crossfeed ensemble modeling.","['best management practice ', ' climate change ', ' HSP2 ', ' HSPF ', ' non-point source ', ' uncertainty ', ' watershed hydrologic model']",1.0
201,Utilizing Artificial intelligence for Forecasting urban Greenery Dynamics: A Case Study of Bhopal City,"Urbanization presents a pressing challenge to the preservation of green spaces within cities, necessitating innovative approaches for monitoring and forecasting urban greenery dynamics. This abstract proposes the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and LiDAR survey data to analyze and predict the evolution of urban greenery. The study employs digitized imagery, topo sheets, master plans, and urban green cover mapping, which are processed using GIS and LiDAR surveys. <sup>5</sup>AI algorithms are then applied to code and analyze the collected data, distinguishing various land surfaces such as live trees, soil, concrete, water bodies, and brownfields within urban areas. These AI-coded models are utilized to track changes in land development, live tree percentages, water content, and seasonal variations over the years. The AI-based analysis of Bhopal city's greenery dynamics from 1984 to 2024 indicates alarming trends. Predictions suggest that by 2050, Bhopal may retain only 9% of its green area as per the master plans, with a significant loss attributed to urban expansion <sup>1</sup>. The study identifies an annual loss rate of 2.5% of greenery, further exacerbated by the encroachment of fringe areas surrounding the city. Built up as projected and predicted for the last 40 years have seen a similarity index of 9.61 and for green cover predictions as per Bhopal Master plan development area, with 9.23 similarity index. <sup>6</sup> The findings underscore the critical role of AI as a tool for environmental forecasting and impact assessment in redrafting the proposed Bhopal Master plan 2047 where by 850 hector of area comes under Bhopal planning area. By leveraging AI-driven analysis, policymakers can gain insights into future greenery trends and formulate proactive strategies for sustainable urban development. Additionally, AI demonstrates potential in monitoring wildlife populations and detecting illegal activities, offering comprehensive solutions for environmental conservation and management.

202,Environmental Impact Assessment of Autonomous Transportation Systems,"The transportation industry has led efforts to fight climate change and reduce air pollution. Autonomous electric vehicles (A-EVs) that use artificial intelligence, next-generation batteries, etc., are predicted to replace conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) in the coming years. In this study, we performed a life cycle assessment to analyze A-EVs and compare their impacts with those from EV and ICEV systems. The scope of the analysis consists of the manufacturing and use phases, and a functional unit of 150,000 miles·passenger was chosen for the assessment. Our results on the impacts from the manufacturing phase of the analyzed systems show that the A-EV systems have higher impacts than other transportation systems in the majority of the impacts categories analyzed (e.g., global warming potential, ozone depletion, human toxicity-cancer) and, on average, EV systems were found to be the slightly more environmentally friendly than ICEV systems. The high impacts in A-EV are due to additional components such as cameras, sonar, and radar. In comparing the impacts from the use phase, we also analyzed the impact of automation and found that the use phase impacts of A-EVs outperform EV and ICEV in many aspects, including global warming potential, acidification, and smog formation. To interpret the results better, we also investigated the impacts of electricity grids on the use phase impact of alternative transportation options for three representative countries with different combinations of renewable and conventional primary energy resources such as hydroelectric, nuclear, and coal. The results revealed that A-EVs used in regions that have hydropower-based electric mix become the most environmentally friendly transportation option than others.","['autonomous vehicles ', ' comparative life cycle analysis ', ' electric vehicles ', ' internal combustion engine vehicles ', ' transportation systems']",1.0
203,Games and fieldwork in agriculture: A systematic review of the 21st century in economics and social science,"Games are particularly relevant for field research in agriculture, where alternative experimental designs can be costly and unfeasible. Games are also popular for non-experimental purposes such as recreating learning experiences and facilitating dialogue with local communities. After a systematic review of the literature, we found that the volume of published studies employing coordination and cooperation games increased during the 2000-2020 period. In recent years, more attention has been given to the areas of natural resource management, conservation, and ecology, particularly in regions important to agricultural sustainability. Other games, such as trust and risk games, have come to be regarded as standards of artefactual and framed field experiments in agriculture. Regardless of their scope, most games’ results are subject to criticism for their internal and external validity. In particular, a significant portion of the games reviewed here reveal recruitment biases towards women and provide few opportunities for continued impact assessment. However, games’ validity should be judged on a case-by-case basis. Specific cultural aspects of games might reflect the real context, and generalizing games’ conclusions to different settings is often constrained by cost and utility. Overall, games in agriculture could benefit from more significant, frequent, and inclusive experiments and data-all possibilities offered by digital technology. Present-day physical distance restrictions may accelerate this shift. New technologies and engaging mediums to approach farmers might present a turning point for integrating experimental and non-experimental games for agriculture in the 21st century.","['Agriculture ', ' Field experiments ', ' Games ', ' Participatory processes ', ' Review']",0.0

The emulator employs a subset of meteorological, land cover, and emission input variables identical to those in CMAQ. An initial assessment of the model based on 3-fold monthly cross-validation during the summer (JJA) demonstrates excellent accuracy for 1-h NO<inf>2</inf> concentration, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.979 and an Index of Agreement (IOA) of 0.989. Subsequently, the model's robustness is examined by training it with NEI 2011 and 2014 data and then evaluating it using NEI 2017 data. This yields an R of 0.949 and an IOA of 0.974. We utilize the emulator to investigate the semi-normalized sensitivity of NO<inf>2</inf> concentrations to NO<inf>x</inf> emissions, which exhibits a satisfactory alignment with CMAQ Decoupled Direct Method (DDM) sensitivities, with an MAE of 0.271 ppb for 1-h sensitivity coefficients. Diurnal cycle analysis of NO<inf>x</inf> sensitivity coefficients spatially averaged in 15 major urban environments indicates slight over- and underestimations of the morning and evening peaks, respectively, with the MAE varying from 0.27 (Dallas) to 0.92 ppb (Los Angeles). Remarkably, the emulator's computational efficiency significantly surpasses CMAQ's, providing more than 400 times the simulation speed on a single CPU and over 600 times when utilizing both CPU and GPU. As such, the emulator represents a promising tool for efficient CMAQ modeling, with potential applications in health impact assessments, emission reduction strategies, and emission inventory optimization.","['CMAQ ', ' Deep Learning ', ' Emulator ', ' NOx Sensitivity ', ' Surface NO2 ', ' U-Net']",1.0

209,Machine Learning for Whole-Building Life Cycle Assessment: A Systematic Literature Review,"Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology to systematically investigating impacts from interactions between environment and human activities. However, the number of parameters and uncertainty factors that characterize built impacts over their full-lifecycle, preclude a broader LCA adoption. This enable faster progress towards reducing building impacts by combining established environmental impact assessment methods with artificial intelligence approaches, such as machine learning (ML) and neural networks. This article will present previous research on ML for LCA of buildings. To achieve this goal, we perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). SLR was governed by the question “What are scientific research developed for Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry in LCA and ML context?”. This SLR was performed in three databases: Scopus, Engineering Village and Web of Science, using keywords: Life Cycle Assessment, Machine Learning, Learning, Building and Neural Network. From SLR, we identified best practices, acquired and developed by other studies, clarifying how to interpret large data sets monitored through advanced analysis to improve LCA.

213,"An Overview Study on Water Desalination, Hybrid RO Systems, and How to Utilize Artificial Intelligence with the System","Water and energy shortages are intensifying globally due to rapid population growth, urbanization, and industrial expansion. While desalination offers a viable solution to water scarcity, it remains hindered by high energy consumption and environmental trade-offs. This study provides a critical and comparative review of widely used desalination technologies—including reverse osmosis (RO), multiple-effect distillation (MED), multi-stage flash (MSF), adsorption desalination (AD), and electrodialysis (ED)-organized into thermal- and membrane-based categories. Emphasis is placed on hybrid desalination systems that integrate multiple methods to improve water recovery and energy efficiency. Benchmark performance metrics such as specific energy consumption (SEC), recovery ratios (RR), and product water costs are discussed to evaluate technological viability. A distinctive contribution of this review is the integration of recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly neural networks, fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithms, in optimizing desalination processes. The study highlights how AI tools can reduce SEC by up to 20% and enhance predictive maintenance, offering real-time system control. Furthermore, it identifies critical gaps in current literature—such as the lack of field-scale validation, limited cost–benefit analysis of AI integration, and insufficient environmental impact assessments of hybrid systems. Finally, the paper proposes concrete multidisciplinary research directions, including AI-material science collaboration for next-generation membranes and policy frameworks supporting modular hybrid desalination units. This synthesis aims to guide future innovations toward scalable, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable desalination technologies.","['Artificial intelligence ', ' Desalination ', ' Hybrid desalination ', ' Machine learning in water treatment ', ' Membrane desalination ', ' Reverse osmosis ', ' Thermal desalination']",0.0

215,Renewing Fiber Optics Infrastructure on Mature Offshore Assets at Campos Basin,"The ""New Fiber Optic Network for Campos Basin"" Project is a strategic initiative aimed at renewing the Campos Basin mature offshore assets' communication infrastructure. The project began as a business case proposition in 2020 and initiated the construction in 2024. It involves laying 500km fiber optic cables connecting two onshore stations, in Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo States to 12 stationary production units at depths of up to 1,800m, providing 100 Gbps links. The paper will describe all the steps in the project approval and deployment phases, including a technical description of the solutions selected for implementation, the risks associated with such choices, and how they are being mitigated. The first illumination is scheduled to take place in 2025, and as such the project is in an advanced completion stage, which shall provide valuable insights into the way in which the project is being implemented. The business case demonstrates the project strategic importance to assure investments returns by supporting the use of current and new technology on monitoring and controlling production and to assure operational safety from remote control rooms and real time integrated operation centers. The project is being executed through an engineering, procurement, construction, and installation (EPCI) contract, which is a comprehensive approach that covers the main aspects of the project from design to installation. During the initial phase, a thorough evaluation was conducted to determine the feasibility and value of investing in connectivity for mature field assets. This involved assessing the infrastructure ability to ensure actual increase of oil production. In the second phase, the project scope was detailed, designed, and the hiring strategy was defined. This phase took place in a post-pandemic booming market scenario and included not only the offshore installation of the optical fiber network but also necessary adjustments to the operating platforms and the design of onshore facilities. A robust governance structure was essential to align the work on the platforms with the EPCI activities. Figure 1 shows the final scope of the Campos Basin optical fiber network project The project faced delays in the environmental licensing process, which were mitigated by adopting a strategy of phasing licenses. Renewing infrastructure in implemented systems is uncommon in the oil and gas industry. However, to remain competitive in a digital era where high technologies, like artificial intelligence, IoT and digital twins can be applied to maximize gains, companies must consider the necessary infrastructure to deploy it.

216,Model Choice for Quantitative Health Impact Assessment and Modelling: An Expert Consultation and Narrative Literature Review,"Background: Health impact assessment (HIA) is a widely used process that aims to identify the health impacts, positive or negative, of a policy or intervention that is not necessarily placed in the health sector. Most HIAs are done prospectively and aim to forecast expected health impacts under assumed policy implementation. HIAs may quantitatively and/ or qualitatively assess health impacts, with this study focusing on the former. A variety of quantitative modelling methods exist that are used for forecasting health impacts, however, they differ in application area, data requirements, assumptions, risk modelling, complexities, limitations, strengths, and comprehensibility. We reviewed relevant models, so as to provide public health researchers with considerations for HIA model choice. Methods: Based on an HIA expert consultation, combined with a narrative literature review, we identified the most relevant models that can be used for health impact forecasting. We narratively and comparatively reviewed the models, according to their fields of application, their configuration and purposes, counterfactual scenarios, underlying assumptions, health risk modelling, limitations and strengths. Results: Seven relevant models for health impacts forecasting were identified, consisting of (i) comparative risk assessment (CRA), (ii) time series analysis (TSA), (iii) compartmental models (CMs), (iv) structural models (SMs), (v) agent-based models (ABMs), (vi) microsimulations (MS), and (vii) artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML). These models represent a variety in approaches and vary in the fields of HIA application, complexity and comprehensibility. We provide a set of criteria for HIA model choice. Researchers must consider that model input assumptions match the available data and parameter structures, the available resources, and that model outputs match the research question, meet expectations and are comprehensible to end-users. Conclusion: The reviewed models have specific characteristics, related to available data and parameter structures, computational implementation, interpretation and comprehensibility, which the researcher should critically consider before HIA model choice.","['Ex-Ante Impact Evaluation ', ' Forecast ', ' Health Impact Assessment ', ' Modelling ', ' Policy']",0.0
217,Impact assessment of food safety news using stacking ensemble learning,"Food safety has always been the focus of public concern. Assessment of the impact of food safety news constituents an important job of the government departments. In this paper we present a method using stacking ensemble learning to assess the impact level of global food safety news. The news used for training the assessment model is collected from the Chinese customs. Each of the news articles is annotated with a label ranging from low impact, medium impact and high impact by the customs officials. For base learners in the ensemble learning model, we use Naive Bayesian, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, FastText, Convolutional Neural Network, LSTM and BERT. A Naive Bayesian-based meta learner is used to integrate the assessment results of the base learners. The proposed method features end to end prediction of news impact using the original news text as input, and it advances the transdisciplinary development of artificial intelligence and risk assessment by improving the accuracy of impact assessment of food safety news compared with traditionally used methods.","['Food safety news ', ' Impact assessment ', ' Stacking ensemble learning']",0.0

Here, we present and discuss the status of some methods revised during a summer school, aiming at better management of coasts and seas. We include novel methods to monitor the coastal and ocean waters (e.g. environmental DNA, drones, imaging and artificial intelligence, climate modelling and spatial planning) and innovative tools to assess the status (e.g. cumulative impacts assessment, multiple pressures, Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool (NEAT), ecosystem services assessment or a new unifying approach). As a concluding remark, some of the most important challenges ahead are assessing the pros and cons of novel methods, comparing them with benchmark technologies and integrating these into long-standing time series for data continuity. This requires transition periods and careful planning, which can be covered through an intense collaboration of current and future European projects on marine biodiversity and ecosystem health.","['Artificial intelligence ', ' Cumulative effects ', ' Drones ', ' eDNA ', ' Environmental status ', ' Imaging']",1.0
219,Environmental Effects in Life Cycle Assessment of Machine-Vision-Driven Spall Repair Material Estimation for Sustainable Road Maintenance,"Portland cement concrete is widely used in road construction due to its durability and minimal maintenance needs. However, its susceptibility to spall highlights the drawbacks of conventional repair methods, including cost inefficiencies, delays, environmental impacts, and safety risks from road closures. To address these challenges, this study evaluated the environmental benefits of a spall detection and repair method employing artificial-intelligence-based computer vision technology. By utilizing machine vision techniques, this approach detects spall damage without road closures and automates the calculation of repair areas and material requirements through a proprietary estimation program. Environmental impact assessments were conducted using life cycle assessment across three frameworks, TRACI, ReCiPe, and ILCD, to compare this method with conventional practices. The results revealed a 79% reduction in the overall environmental impacts, including significant decreases in global warming due to shorter road closures and reduced material waste. Resource usage improved through optimized processes, and air pollution decreased, with lower emissions of smog and particulates. This study highlights the potential of machine-vision-driven repair material quantity takeoff as a more efficient and sustainable alternative. The results of this study will help institutional engineers and practitioners adopt sustainable strategies for green infrastructure repair and integrate them into various infrastructure maintenance practices to contribute to the development of sustainable urban environments.","['environmentally sustainable ', ' life cycle assessment ', ' road maintenance ', ' spall repair material quantity takeoff ', ' sustainable infrastructure']",1.0
220,Traffic-related air pollution monitoring laboratory with computer vision based traffic count and cloud based data visualization techniques,"Motor vehicle exhaust is a significant source of urban air pollution. The most widely reported pollutants in vehicular exhaust include carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, unburned hydrocarbons, particulate matter, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other organic compounds. People living or otherwise spending substantial time near busy highways are exposed to these pollutants and it is becoming increasingly important to understand the emission and health effects of road traffic. Many roadside areas have no or limited sustained monitoring capabilities, making it difficult to quantify the major pollution sources. Real-time mobile air monitoring has been demonstrated to have an advantage of identifying spatial and temporal differences of on-road traffic pollutants from different road types, traffic intensities, and road features. The Houston Advanced Research Center (HARC) has developed the Mobile Acquisition of Real-time Concentrations (MARC) laboratory, which consists of a Ford F-350 passenger van outfitted with a Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS), NOx analyzer, CO analyzer, GPS unit, camera, and metrological equipment. Front view camera mounted on the front of the van is used to get the traffic intensities using a machine learning based computer vision algorithm by tracking and counting the number of the vehicle in the vicinity. This allows for the fast measurement of geotagged gaseous pollutant concentrations correlated with traffic intensities. The data recorded from the van is uploaded to an off-site database via an adaptive interface that supports 3G/4G infrastructure and the information is broadcasted to a website in real-time. MARC is used during 2018 the Health Impact Assessment (HIA) of the North Houston Highway Improvement Project (NHHIP) in Houston, TX. The main goal of the study was to quantify and explain the potential co-benefits and co-harms to health associated with the proposed changes to the I-45 corridor from Beltway 8 North to the I-69 spur south of downtown Houston.","['Air quality monitoring ', ' LabVIEW ', ' Mobile Laboratory ', ' OpenCV ', ' PTR-MS ', ' Real-time data ', ' TensorFlow ', ' Traffic related air pollution ', ' Vehicle counting']",1.0

223,"The social impact of distance learning in Roman schools: “Success,” social innovation, teaching practices","Faced with the national emergency linked to the spread of COVID-19 in Italy, digital technologies have made it possible to carry out the ordinary activities of the various educational agencies through the main tool of Distance Learning (DaD). The intensive use of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the guarantee of accessibility represent an enabling prerogative for current education systems, enriching training in a variety of ways and opportunities which must be accessible to all. ICTs take on a propulsive function for change in schools because they make it possible to affect the school setting, to transform the learning environment by redesigning space, reorganizing time, modifying communication and socialization processes, encouraging, in students, the development of key competencies in digital literacy and media education. Considering the context of a school transformed and renewed by the teaching and training potential of ICT, it becomes central to reconstruct the requests and needs developed by the practitioners of educational policies to cope with the reorganization of teaching methods and times at the time of DaD. Starting from these premises, the paper focuses attention on the social impact (Stern, 2016) of DaD to evaluate: the extent and intensity of the methodological-didactic innovation required of teachers for the organization and conducting remote lessons; the increase—in students—of transversal and digital literacy skills (team working, problem solving, etc.) potentially associated with the use of ICTs; the involvement and collaboration of families in the process of assessing and verifying learning. The reflection is part of a broader research project by the University of Sapienza University of Rome entitled “The social impact assessment of DaD after COVID-19”; a 3 year evaluation research addressed to a typological sample of upper secondary schools in Rome classified on the basis of the Infrastructure and Equipment indicator of the Rav and the social effect of the school (school effect) on the academic performance of students in the tests Invalsi. The evaluation aimed to identify—from the DaD experience—indications useful in re-designing the school's intervention strategy in the phases following the pandemic; for this reason it adopted an analysis perspective that valorized the positive and most successful aspects in the testimonies of the teachers and students involved in the first phase of the research (conducted in May–June 2021). Within the framework of the Positive Thinking Evaluation, the empirical evidence—collected through the administration/conduction of semi-structured interviews, focus groups, online ethnographic observation of the lessons in DaD—will allow us to reflect on some dimensions of success and of particular social innovation for the teachers' teaching practices and the students' learning processes in DaD. In the Positive Thinking Evaluation, success is a positive effect (not just a “good practice”), even an unexpected one, of an activity that has produced a positive change in the context of program implementation.","['didactic innovation ', ' digital skills ', ' distance learning ', ' Positive Thinking Evaluation ', ' social impact']",0.0

225,Bibliometric analysis and data visualization of research trends in lithium-ion and nickel-metal-hydride battery recycling processes,"As the demand for battery-powered devices surges, sustainable management of end-of-life batteries becomes imperative. By employing bibliometric analysis techniques and data visualization tools, this review paper synthesizes existing literature on lithium-ion (Li-ion) and nickel metal hydride battery (NiMH) recycling, highlighting key trends, research hotspots, and emerging methodologies. This analysis encompasses technological advancements, environmental impact assessment, and the efficiency of recycling processes. It further unpacks the synergistic effects of simultaneously recycling lithium-ion and NiMH batteries. Despite other emerging battery recycling technologies, hydrometallurgy is the most studied, and current research is focused on using green solvents. Findings suggest that energy policy remains loosely connected to battery recycling research, underscoring a gap in aligning regulatory frameworks with technological innovation to create a profitable circular economy. This paper also highlights the need for further research to optimize the proposed recycling routes and emphasizes the importance of establishing clear key performance indicators to assess the energy consumption and environmental impact of the studied processes. A recommendation made after the analysis is that multi-objective optimization techniques should be adopted, as single-variable optimization techniques are not adequate to optimize battery recycling technologies given their multidimensional nature. The information detailed in this review can help researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders to devise sustainable and efficient approaches to battery recycling.","['Battery recycling ', ' Bibliometric analysis ', ' Direct recycling ', ' Hydrometallurgy ', ' Lithium-ion batteries ', ' Nickel metal hydride batteries ', ' Synergistic recycling']",1.0

228,Impact Assessment of Efficient Denoising Techniques in AI-Based Low-Cost INS/GPS Integration During Blockage of GPS Satellites,"Low-cost micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)-based inertial navigation system (INS) sensors present long-term drift and different stochastic errors over time, which, in turn, tends to degrade the positioning accuracy of the artificial intelligence (AI)-based GPS/INS navigation systems during GPS outages. We address this issue by analyzing and modeling various stochastic errors of these sensors and our efficient noise reduction method can improve the accuracy of such navigation systems. In the present work, we propose our efficient adaptive noise reduction method based on the Allan variance (AV) analysis technique in order to choose more reliable, appropriate, and optimum parameters of the noise reduction method, which can help remove stochastic noises efficiently while preserving vehicles motion information. In our low-cost AI-based GPS/INS navigation system, more accurate and smoother INS sensor measurements with less complexity, as an input of intelligence structure, can provide better training and less estimation error and better generalization ability in the uncertainty-oriented environment. Eventually, in order to assess the effect of the proposed noise reduction method based on the AV method on the low-cost AI-based GPS/INS navigation systems under the GPS signal blockages, two different candidates from AI-based models are selected according to their ability in modeling random noise inputs. Then, their performance with and without the proposed noise reduction method is evaluated. The obtained results indicate that the proposed noise reduction method significantly improves positioning accuracy in AI-based low-cost GPS/INS integrated systems under GPS signal blockages using real data collected even with a high-speed test vehicle.","['Allan variance ', ' Artificial intelligence ', ' Denoising ', ' INS/GPS integration ', ' Low-cost ', ' Low-precision MEMS']",0.0
229,Availability of Evidence for Predictive Machine Learning Algorithms in Primary Care: A Systematic Review,"Importance: The aging and multimorbid population and health personnel shortages pose a substantial burden on primary health care. While predictive machine learning (ML) algorithms have the potential to address these challenges, concerns include transparency and insufficient reporting of model validation and effectiveness of the implementation in the clinical workflow. Objectives: To systematically identify predictive ML algorithms implemented in primary care from peer-reviewed literature and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Conformité Européene (CE) registration databases and to ascertain the public availability of evidence, including peer-reviewed literature, gray literature, and technical reports across the artificial intelligence (AI) life cycle. Evidence Review: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Emcare, Academic Search Premier, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, MathSciNet, AAAI.org (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence), arXiv, Epistemonikos, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar were searched for studies published between January 2000 and July 2023, with search terms that were related to AI, primary care, and implementation. The search extended to CE-marked or FDA-approved predictive ML algorithms obtained from relevant registration databases. Three reviewers gathered subsequent evidence involving strategies such as product searches, exploration of references, manufacturer website visits, and direct inquiries to authors and product owners. The extent to which the evidence for each predictive ML algorithm aligned with the Dutch AI predictive algorithm (AIPA) guideline requirements was assessed per AI life cycle phase, producing evidence availability scores. Findings: The systematic search identified 43 predictive ML algorithms, of which 25 were commercially available and CE-marked or FDA-approved. The predictive ML algorithms spanned multiple clinical domains, but most (27 [63%]) focused on cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Most (35 [81%]) were published within the past 5 years. The availability of evidence varied across different phases of the predictive ML algorithm life cycle, with evidence being reported the least for phase 1 (preparation) and phase 5 (impact assessment) (19% and 30%, respectively). Twelve (28%) predictive ML algorithms achieved approximately half of their maximum individual evidence availability score. Overall, predictive ML algorithms from peer-reviewed literature showed higher evidence availability compared with those from FDA-approved or CE-marked databases (45% vs 29%). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings indicate an urgent need to improve the availability of evidence regarding the predictive ML algorithms' quality criteria. Adopting the Dutch AIPA guideline could facilitate transparent and consistent reporting of the quality criteria that could foster trust among end users and facilitating large-scale implementation.",,0.0
230,Monitoring carbon emissions using deep learning and statistical process control: a strategy for impact assessment of governments’ carbon reduction policies,"Across the globe, governments are developing policies and strategies to reduce carbon emissions to address climate change. Monitoring the impact of governments’ carbon reduction policies can significantly enhance our ability to combat climate change and meet emissions reduction targets. One promising area in this regard is the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in carbon reduction policy and strategy monitoring. While researchers have explored applications of AI on data from various sources, including sensors, satellites, and social media, to identify areas for carbon emissions reduction, AI applications in tracking the effect of governments’ carbon reduction plans have been limited. This study presents an AI framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and statistical process control (SPC) for the monitoring of variations in carbon emissions, using UK annual CO2 emission (per capita) data, covering a period between 1750 and 2021. This paper used LSTM to develop a surrogate model for the UK’s carbon emissions characteristics and behaviours. As observed in our experiments, LSTM has better predictive abilities than ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing and feedforward artificial neural networks (ANN) in predicting CO2 emissions on a yearly prediction horizon. Using the deviation of the recorded emission data from the surrogate process, the variations and trends in these behaviours are then analysed using SPC, specifically Shewhart individual/moving range control charts. The result shows several assignable variations between the mid-1990s and 2021, which correlate with some notable UK government commitments to lower carbon emissions within this period. The framework presented in this paper can help identify periods of significant deviations from a country’s normal CO2 emissions, which can potentially result from the government’s carbon reduction policies or activities that can alter the amount of CO2 emissions.","['ANN ', ' ARIMA ', ' Artificial intelligence ', ' Carbon emissions ', ' Climate change ', ' Deep learning ', ' Energy policy ', ' Exponential smoothing ', ' LSTM ', ' Statistical process control']",1.0

Compressive strength tests were performed on these specimens at 7, 28, and 90 days, and their mechanical properties were evaluated. Concrete classes (Class A, B, C, D) were determined using the compressive strength values obtained for each test day. The results of each concrete class were analyzed using a unique interpretable multi-objective rule extraction model, and the range values of the materials used were determined. The applied multi-objective rule extraction method is used for the first time in the literature, and its most important novelty is that, unlike other black-box artificial intelligence methods, it can also enable the creation of sustainable concrete recipes. After the range values of the materials used were found by automatic rule extraction, environmental impact assessments were performed. Among the impact categories, energy consumption and global warming potential were considered. The energy consumption results for Rule 4 were calculated as 814.8–1467.1 MJ, respectively, and a reduction of approximately 44.5% was observed. Similarly, global warming potentials for Rule 3 were obtained as 187.0–267.3 kg m<sup>3</sup>, respectively, with a reduction of about 30%. The limitations and future prospects of the study have been extensively investigated. The importance of adopting explainable/interpretable artificial intelligence-based approaches within the scope of sustainable development and circular economy goals to develop social infrastructure and buildings with low carbon emissions that are feasible in terms of mechanical and environmental properties is highlighted. Multi-Objective Optimization Based Innovative Interpretable Artificial Intelligence Method, used for the first time in mechanical and environmental modelling of sustainable concretes, can make significant contributions to the literature and future studies.","['Construction and demolition waste ', ' Explainable and interpretable artificial intelligence ', ' Life cycle assessment ', ' Natural resource management ', ' Sustainable development ', ' Waste management and recycling']",0.0
233,Decision Integrated Tree: A Machine Learning Model to Predict CO2 Emission from Power Plants,"Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stem from human activities like burning fossil fuels, contributing to the greenhouse effect and climate change. In the United States, the electricity generation sector is a significant emitter, primarily from coal and natural gas. Efforts to transition to cleaner energy sources aim to mitigate CO2 emissions and their adverse environmental impacts (global warming, sea level rise, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity). In this research, a novel approach called Decision Integrated Tree (DIT) is presented, which investigates with a large dataset, captures complex relationships, addresses non-linearity and complexity in CO2 emission data. It commences with dataset collection (containing 5094 data points and six features), followed by thorough data preparation involving cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to ensure data quality. Subsequently, our proposed DIT model is applied, incorporating various techniques (ensemble methods, pruning, and regularization). Experiments evaluate the performance of the model using significant metrics including R-squared Score (R<sup>2</sup>), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). From the experiment, we obtained 98.2% R<sup>2</sup>, 0.634 MSE, and 0.421 MAE predicting CO2 emissions from power plants. The integration of ensemble methods, feature engineering, and hybrid models within the DIT framework enhances predictive capabilities and informs decision-making in environmental policy, industry, and research. Strong performance metrics validate the model’s reliability, while a variegated large dataset enable robust predictions in CO2 emission forecasting. However, deep learning integration and more data inclusion are needed to enhance the performance of the model and applicability for future advancements in environmental modeling.","['CO2 Emission ', ' Decision Integrated Tree (DIT) ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Power Plants ', ' Pruning ', ' R-squared Score']",1.0
234,Number of Publications on New Clinical Prediction Models: A Bibliometric Review,"Background: Concerns have been expressed about the abundance of new clinical prediction models (CPMs) proposed in the literature. However, the extent of this proliferation in prediction research remains unclear. Objective: This study aimed to estimate the total and annual number of CPM development-related publications available across all medical fields. Methods: Using a validated search strategy, we conducted a systematic search of literature for prediction model studies published in Pubmed and Embase between 1995 and the end of 2020. By taking random samples for each year, we identified eligible studies that developed a multivariable model (ie, diagnostic or prognostic) for individual-level prediction of a health outcome across all medical fields. Exclusion criteria included development of models with a single predictor, studies not involving humans, methodological studies, conference abstracts, articles with unavailable full text, and those not available in English. We estimated the total and annual number of published regression-based multivariable CPM development articles, based on the total number of publications, proportion of included articles, and the search sensitivity. Furthermore, we used an adjusted Poisson regression to extrapolate our results to the period 1950‐2024. Additionally, we estimated the number of articles that developed CPMs using techniques other than regression (eg, machine learning). Results: From a random sample of 10,660 articles published between 1995 and 2020, 109 regression-based CPM development articles were included. We estimated that 82,772 (95% CI 65,313‐100,231) CPM development articles using regression were published, with an acceleration in model development from 2010 onward. With the addition of articles that developed non-regression-based CPMs, the number increased to 147,714 (95% CI 125,201-170,226). After extrapolation to the years 1950‐2024, the number of articles increased to 156,673 and 248,431 for regression-based models and total CPMs, respectively. Conclusions: Based on a representative sample of publications from the literature, we estimated that nearly 250,000 articles reporting the development of CPMs across all medical fields were published until 2024. CPM development–related publications continue to increase in number. To prevent research waste and close the gap between research and clinical practice, focus should shift away from developing new CPMs to facilitating model validation and impact assessment of the plethora of existing CPMs. Limitations of this study include restriction of search to articles available in English and development of the validated search strategy prior to the popularity of artificial intelligence and machine learning models.","['clinical practice ', ' clinical prediction ', ' external validation ', ' health outcomes ', ' model development ', ' online databases ', ' prediction modeling ', ' public health ', ' publication ', ' publication records ', ' research waste']",0.0
235,A framework to enhance disaster debris estimation with AI and aerial photogrammetry,"This study addresses the critical need to enhance disaster preparedness and response, focusing on hurricane impact assessment and debris estimation. Accurate assessments in this context are critical for post-event search-and-rescue (SAR) operations and resource distribution. Recent computing advancements are revealing the potential of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in collecting data and assisting with post-hurricane reconnaissance. However, the use of AI and UAV photogrammetry for accurate disaster impact analysis remains underexplored. To this end, this study proposes a damage and debris analysis framework harnessing reality capture through aerial imagery and photogrammetry. Within this framework, a region-based neural network is leveraged to detect debris locations in aerial imagery with favorable performance. In a testbed within the Beaumont-Port Arthur region, in Southeast Texas, this study performs 3D reality captures of the built environment. Since the accuracy of the 3D reality capture is of importance in research areas associated with time-sensitive disaster response, we further investigate the optimal 2D aerial imagery overlap ratio required to generate a sufficiently accurate 3D model for disaster impact analysis and debris volume estimation. Results indicate that, in the case of aerial imagery for infrastructure systems, a minimum of 60 % overlap is recommended for damage assessment and debris analysis. In contrast, for flat green areas, a minimum of 50 % overlap is adequate. Overall, for disaster response applications, our study reveals that an overlap ratio between 60 % and 70 % is optimal for achieving a balance between time efficiency and data quality in aerial data collection. These quantitative recommendations are crucial for enabling efficient disaster response efforts. Additionally, our study outcomes will improve disaster impact analysis and facilitating timely and effective response strategies.","['Artificial intelligence ', ' Debris estimation ', ' Disaster response ', ' Photogrammetry ', ' Unmanned aerial vehicle']",0.0

237,Data visualization and enhanced learning in engineering education through oil pollution studies and environmental impact assessment,"Big Data and Data Analytics have in recent times become important areas of focus in academia, in business and in society. This paper utilises experiments involving data visualisation of oil pollution studies and their effects on environment for enhanced learning in engineering education. Tracking and analysis of images and the use of accessible applications for the analysis of acquired data revealed the level of impact of the different types of oil pollution on grass vegetation. In accounting for these changes the primary RGB colours and corresponding values are used. The use of spectral analysis applications available in spectroscopy and comparison of results would in future prove useful in assessing some aspects of these changes in relation to wavelength and colours changes. The results of these studies would contribute in no small measure to the determination of best cleaning strategies for oil spills.","['Data visualisation ', ' Engineering education ', ' Enhanced learning ', ' Environment ', ' Oil pollution']",1.0
238,Generative artificial intelligence (ChatGPT) technology and its impact on the development of digital entrepreneurship skills among university students,"This research aimed to study the impact of generative AI technology, specifically ChatGPT, on the development of digital entrepreneurship skills among university students. It explores how AI technologies can be integrated into higher education to develop core digital entrepreneurship skills, including innovation, creative thinking, and entrepreneurial initiative. A quasi-experimental design was employed, involving two groups of graduate students from the College of Education at King Khalid University. The experimental group was exposed to generative AI platforms (ChatGPT), while the control group was trained using traditional educational methods. To measure the impact, assessment tools, such as the Digital Entrepreneurship Scale and the Entrepreneurial Product Scorecard, were used before and after the intervention. The results indicated significant positive differences in favor of the group that used ChatGPT, demonstrating improved digital entrepreneurship skills and the ability to create pioneering digital products. Generative AI technologies provided a conducive environment for students to systematically organize their ideas, generate innovative solutions, and effectively analyze data. This research demonstrates that the integration of generative AI platforms, such as ChatGPT, into university curricula has a positive impact on the development of digital entrepreneurship skills. These technologies also enhance students' entrepreneurial mindset and innovative capabilities, helping to bridge the gap between academic learning and the practical requirements of the digital job market. Educational institutions should therefore integrate generative AI into their curricula and provide comprehensive training for faculty and students to maximize the benefits of these technologies. In doing so, universities can better prepare students for dynamic professional environments and foster sustainable and innovative digital entrepreneurship initiatives.","['Digital entrepreneurship ', ' e-platforms ', ' Generative AI']",0.0
239,Integrating life cycle assessment into green infrastructure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of urban sustainability strategies,"Green infrastructure (GI) is increasingly vital for cities addressing environmental challenges, climate change, and sustainability through nature-based solutions. However, the inconsistent use of life cycle assessment (LCA) methods—including variations in impact categories, data collection methods, system boundaries, and functional units—hinders effective policymaking and comparison among projects. This study conducted a systematic review and semi-quantitative meta-analysis, following PRISMA guidelines. Out of 334 publications (2014–2024) identified from Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, 40 studies met the inclusion criteria. Analysis included critical sustainability indicators: carbon emissions, water footprint, energy use, land-use changes, and air pollution. Traditional LCA was most commonly applied, yet integration with economic (life cycle costing, LCC) and social dimensions (social LCA, S-LCA) remained limited. Meta-analysis indicated a slight positive correlation between standard LCA and water footprint (0.27) but a negative correlation with energy consumption (−0.18), suggesting trade-offs between water management and energy efficiency. Economic assessments (LCC) were moderately linked to land-use changes (0.15), reflecting economic considerations in GI projects. Social assessments (S-LCA) correlated positively with air pollution (0.20), highlighting potential conflicts between social and environmental objectives. Although GI significantly contributes to urban sustainability, the lack of standardized LCA methods limits comparative analyses and practical policy development. Standardizing methodologies, unifying impact assessments, integrating environmental, economic, and social evaluations, and developing financial incentives and advanced technological tools like artificial intelligence are critical steps forward. Future research should prioritize refining LCA accuracy, comprehensive lifecycle cost–benefit integration, and multi-dimensional sustainability analyses to better inform urban resilience policies.","['climate resilience ', ' ecosystem services evaluation ', ' green infrastructure ', ' life cycle assessment ', ' life cycle costing ', ' policy standardization ', ' social life cycle assessment ', ' urban sustainability']",1.0
240,Neuromorphic hardware-driven artificial intelligence for environmental interaction,"Over the past few decades, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has rapidly developed from systems capable of performing simple automated tasks to complex intelligent robots that are reshaping industry and daily life. However, while AI has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing vast amounts of data and executing predefined tasks, the essence of true intelligence lies in its ability to interact deeply with dynamic environments and make adaptive decisions in real time. AI systems must transcend their current limitations and evolve into entities that can autonomously perceive, learn, and adapt to their surroundings without relying on human intervention. A notable challenge in achieving this goal is the fundamental contradiction between the discrete symbolic processing methods employed by traditional AI systems and the continuous nature of the physical world. Real-world environments are inherently continuous, with phenomena such as motion, aging, and light variations that unfold seamlessly over time. In contrast, AI systems often rely on discrete representations, such as pixelated images or labeled data points, which inherently fail to capture the subtle, cumulative effects of continuous changes. The disconnect between discrete processing and continuous reality underscores the need for AI systems to develop new paradigms that enable continuous environmental modeling and real-time adaptation. Another critical limitation is in the constrained feature spaces of traditional AI systems, which makes it difficult to handle the infinite possibilities of open environments. Dynamic environments are characterized by an ever-expanding state space in which parameters such as object shapes, lighting conditions, and interactions between entities combine in countless unforeseen ways. Current AI systems, constrained by their predefined feature dimensions, struggle to adapt to novel scenarios outside of their training data. To address this limitation, AI systems must develop elastic cognitive frameworks that can dynamically expand their feature spaces, thereby enabling them to adaptively process unforeseen information. Furthermore, the static deployment model of traditional AI systems poses a barrier to achieving true intelligence. Most AI systems are trained offline and deployed with fixed algorithms, which limit their ability to learn and adapt in real time as they interact with their environments. Intelligent entities must be capable of continuous learning and evolution, updating their knowledge, and decision-making processes based on new experiences. This requires overturning existing static learning paradigms, enabling AI systems to continuously refine their models and adapt to changing circumstances. The future of AI lies in its ability to deeply interact with and adapt to complex and dynamic environments. By addressing the limitations of discrete processing, fixed feature spaces, and static deployment models, and by leveraging advancements in electronic materials, we can pave the way for truly intelligent systems that operate autonomously and evolve alongside their environments. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of the interaction technologies between AI and the environment, discussing current advancements and exploring future innovations and applications of AI in environmental interactions, as well as the challenges from the perspective of electronic materials. It aims to inspire further research and innovation in this transformative field, ultimately unlocking the full potential of AI.","['artificial intelligence ', ' environmental interaction ', ' hardware adaptation ', ' neural networks ', ' neuromorphic devices']",0.0
241,"MADM-Q, an efficient multi-attribute decision-making support system for offshore decommissioning","With decades of development, some offshore facilities are reaching their design lives and need to be decommissioned. However, due to the limitation of regulations, technologies, and other aspects, which decommissioning options should be chosen is a challenging task. This paper introduces a multi-attribute quantitative evaluation system called MADM-Q (Multi-Attribute Decision Making-Quantitative), which can show decision makers with decommissioning options’ cost, risk, and environmental impact assessment results. The system consists of an input, output, and three processing modules. The Engineering Cost Evaluation System (ECES) is the first bottom-up approach cost assessment model in offshore facility decommissioning research. The Hierarchical Analyst Domino Evaluation System (HADES) acts as the risk assessment module, considering Domino Effect Accidents (DEAs) and providing accurate and rapid quantitative risk assessment results. The third sub-model, Composite Impact Evaluation System (CIES) assesses the environmental and socioeconomic impacts of the project. The system can obtain the basic cost range and the Individual Risk Per Annum (IRPA) value of the project quickly by using some simple inputs. The results of ECES and HADES reflects excellent accuracy - 12% cost evaluation average deviation and 1.43E-04 IRPA evaluation bias. Although currently, the HADES is a quasi-dynamic risk assessment method, it would be easy to develop it into a real-time dynamic risk monitoring and assessment system by combining advanced technologies such as digital twin technology and sensor technology.","['CIES ', ' ECES ', ' HADES ', ' MCDA ', ' Modular designing ', ' Offshore decommissioning']",1.0
242,Advancing microplastic analysis in the era of artificial intelligence: From current applications to the promise of generative AI,"The proliferation of microplastics (MPs) in aquatic and terrestrial environments poses significant threats to ecosystems and human health. Over the past 20 years, significant efforts have been dedicated to understanding the distribution, sources, and impacts of MPs. However, traditional methods for the detection and analysis of MPs rely on labor-intensive and time-consuming techniques, often lacking the needed precision. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in environmental science, offering innovative solutions to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of MP analysis. Despite significant scientific advancements, there is a lack of critical review that consolidates the key applications of AI in MP analysis, synthesizes knowledge gained, and navigates for future research directions. This review is the first to thoroughly explore the exciting role of AI across the entire life cycle of MP analysis—from collection to characterization, dynamic modeling, impact assessment, and management of MP pollution. Specifically, AI-driven autonomous drones and robotics have emerged as promising solutions to revolutionize MP collection practices. Computer vision systems provide robust solutions for the identification and quantification of MPs in diverse environmental matrices. Additionally, data-driven modeling using machine-learning and deep-learning techniques facilitates accurate evaluation of MP pollution levels and their impacts, facilitating the design of effective management strategies. Despite these advancements, several knowledge gaps remain, including data scarcity and quality issues; the readiness of the AI models; and model interpretability, transparency, and reproducibility issues. Addressing these gaps requires the development of standardized protocols for improved data infrastructure, the adoption of more advanced and groundbreaking AI tools (such as generative AI), and the encouraging of multidisciplinary collaborations. Through these efforts, AI has the potential to revolutionize MP research, leading to a more comprehensive and effective response to MP pollution.","['artificial intelligence ', ' deep learning ', ' generative AI ', ' machine learning ', ' microplastics']",1.0
243,Artificial intelligence and machine learning in environmental impact prediction for soil pollution management – case for EIA process,"Scientific predictions are a key component of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), which can indicate the level of change within an environmental sphere (e.g., soil). As part of the EIA process, decision-making in mitigating complex environmental problems such as maintaining soil quality can be challenging, especially in data-sparse locations. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can ameliorate but the literature suggests that the deployment of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in soil research is concentrated mostly in developed countries. The potential of ML in managing soil pollution from complex mixture of heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, and physicochemical factors is rarely explored. To address this research gap, we built robust models that increase the accuracy of impact prediction based on new experimental soil data from a data-sparse region of Africa (i.e., Nigeria). The algorithms applied are artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), regression tree (RT), and random forest (RF). The study also implemented a multivariate linear regression (MLR) model as a baseline. Key findings include (a) the MLR model performed less than the machine learning models largely due to the nonlinearity of data; (b) Log-normalization helped to improve the predictive capability of all models as the effects of statistical variability were removed; (c) the RF model had the best performance in terms of correlation coefficient, mean absolute error, and root mean square error, and (d) the machine learning models showed improved performance with increased correlation and lower error between the actual and predicted soil electrical conductivity values. Our results imply that data sparsity may no longer be an excuse for the non-use of quantitative impact prediction in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes. This could change how EIAs are conducted and enhance sustainability in natural resource exploitation, globally. Future work will apply algorithms for automated feature selection to obtain optimal subset of soil quality measurements that will further improve the accuracy of the models.","['Artificial Intelligence ', ' Environmental Data Science ', ' Environmental Impact Assessment ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Multivariate Linear Regression ', ' Soil Quality ', ' Sustainability']",1.0

247,Rethinking Non-discrimination Law in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,"Irrespective of artificial intelligence (“AI”) developments of our age, discrimination always found a way to influence our communities directly or indirectly. On the other hand, discrimination of individuals is prohibited as a reflection of the principle of equality, in the constitutions of contemporary societies and in international laws regulating the fundamental rights of the individual. Within the framework of the mechanisms improved depending upon this principle and constitutional basis, a legal struggle is waged against discrimination of individuals as a person or as part of a community. However, discrimination has reached a different dimension in the digital environment with the developing technologies, especially AI systems. Such systems bring new problems and the anti-discrimination rules and mechanisms generated for the physical world cannot completely find a solution. The discrimination of AI systems could arise from reasons such as biased data sets and AI models, insufficient training data, and human-induced prejudices. At the same time, due to the black box problem in AI systems, the fact that it is not always clear which inputs lead to which result, and which inputs are another problem in the detection of discriminatory results. On the other side, problems caused by different applications such as credit scoring, exam grade determination, face recognition, and predictive policing, in which individuals face explicitly discrimination due to AI systems, are also emerging more and more. However, individuals do not always know that they deal with an AI system, and they may or may not be subject to discrimination. For instance, it has been revealed that the algorithm used in visa applications in the UK ranks the applications as red, green, and yellow, yet classifies a certain group as persons with suspicious nationality, and applications made by persons from this nationality receive higher risk scores and are more likely to be rejected. Even though the use of AI systems in our socio-economic life has reached an indispensable point, the prevention of discriminatory results caused by these systems also triggers the obligations of states in the context of fundamental rights. In this regard, the state has an obligation not to use discriminatory AI systems within the scope of its negative obligation; again, it has the obligation to ensure that private institutions or individuals cannot violate a fundamental right against other individuals in a way that is contrary to non-discrimination, within the scope of the positive obligation of the state. Furthermore, as in the process of protecting each fundamental right, the state will have an obligation to ensure that AI systems do not cause discrimination, and in case of discrimination, to eliminate the elements that cause it. In parallel with the development of AI technologies, it may be necessary to reinterpret existing rules and mechanisms or to establish new rules and mechanisms. In this sense, as in the draft Artificial Intelligence Act (“AIA”), having regard to the fact that AI has become a unique sector and its spheres of influence, organizing an institution specific to AI, and establishing an audit mechanism for developing and placing AI on the market, could be considered as an effective way to prevent and eliminate discrimination. In this regard, this Article aims to open a discussion about implementing newly emerging solutions to the Turkish legal framework, such as introducing a pre-audit mechanism as “AI—human rights impact assessment”, establishing AI audit mechanisms, and notification to individuals that they are subject to discrimination.","['Artificial intelligence ', ' Audit mechanisms ', ' Human rights ', ' Non-discrimination']",0.0

249,Well-being impact assessment of artificial intelligence – A search for causality and proposal for an open platform for well-being impact assessment of AI systems,"In recent years, the well-being impact assessment approach has been applied in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Existing well-being frameworks and tools provide a relevant starting point. Taking into account its multidimensional nature, well-being assessment is well suited to assess both the expected positive effects of the technology as well as unintended negative consequences. To-date the establishment of causal links mostly stems from intuitive causal models. Such approaches neglect the fact that to prove causal links between the operation of an AI system and observed effects is difficult due to the immense complexity of the socio-technical context. This article aims at providing a framework for ascertaining the attribution of effects of observed impact of AI on well-being. An elaborated approach to impact assessment potentially enabling causal inferences is demonstrated. Furthermore, a new Open Platform for Well-Being Impact Assessment of AI systems (OPIA) is introduced, which is based on a distributed community to build reproducible evidence through effective identification, refinement, iterative testing, and cross-validation of expected causal structures.","['Artificial intelligence ', ' Causality ', ' Complexity ', ' Impact assessment ', ' Open science ', ' Well-being']",0.0
250,Lightweight Model Using Graph Neural Networks for Air Quality Impact Assessment on Human Health,"Current air monitoring stations can only tell us the purity or pollution of the air through the Air Quality Index (AQI). Using the Air Quality Index is not enough when we need to monitor the air environment in areas such as factories, industrial parks, and space areas where many people are working. In this article, we propose a lightweight deep learning model to assess the impact of air quality on human health using the following layers: i) The Timestamp Graph Message Passing layer for graph-based data aggregation affecting prediction results; ii) The Timestamp Graph Convolution layer for graph-based feature expansion affecting prediction results; iii) The Temporal Graph Message Passing layer, which is used to aggregate data based on time series graphs; iv) The Temporal Graph Convolution layer for feature extraction based on time series graphs; v) The Simple Artificial Neural Network for graph classification based on data of nodes.

251,IARA: An Underwater Acoustic Database,"Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have been driven by the availability of diverse and well-structured public databases; however public databases for passive sonar classification remain scarce. To address this gap, this paper presents a new public underwater acoustic labeled database collected during the Santos Basin Soundscape Monitoring Project carried out by PETROBRAS in compliance with conditions required by the federal environmental licensing process conducted by IBAMA. This database expands public resources, containing 129 h 34 min of audio across 1825 recordings (approximately 50 GB). In contrast, existing public databases include ShipsEar (3 h 9 min, 90 recordings) and DeepShip (47 h 4 min, 613 recordings). The dataset provides several hours of general-purpose recordings; however, in this work, only classification was explored, as this is a typical use of such databases in the literature. Baselines were established using Random Forest, MLP, and CNN classification models, with the MLP achieving the best performance: a balanced accuracy of 67.48 ± 1.24% and an F1-score of 66.72 ± 1.17%, evaluated using 5 × 2 cross-validation. The primary contribution of this work is the introduction of the database and its associated baselines for underwater acoustic target recognition tasks, with the aim of providing a valuable resource for the research community. The study also emphasizes the importance of proper data selection, including the use of exclusion regions to enhance signal confidence. Generalization experiments highlight the critical role of dataset diversity, demonstrating that models often struggle to generalize to other datasets. These findings underscore the necessity of diverse, well-structured databases to improve model robustness across varied acoustics scenarios.","['IARA ', ' ship noise dataset ', ' underwater acoustic dataset ', ' underwater acoustic target recognition']",1.0

253,Deep learning-based aerial image segmentation with open data for disaster impact assessment,"Satellite images are an extremely valuable resource in the aftermath of natural disasters such as hurricanes and tsunamis where they can be used for risk assessment and disaster management. In order to provide timely and actionable information for disaster response, a framework utilising segmentation neural networks is proposed to identify impacted areas and accessible roads in post-disaster scenarios. The effectiveness of pretraining with ImageNet -for the task of aerial image segmentation has been analysed and performances of popular segmentation models compared. Experimental results show that pretraining on ImageNet usually improves the segmentation performance for a number of models. Open data available from OpenStreetMap (OSM) is used for training, forgoing the need for time-consuming manual annotation. The method also makes use of graph theory to update road network data available from OSM and to detect the changes caused by a natural disaster. Extensive experiments on data from the 2018 tsunami that struck Palu, Indonesia show the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

255,Environmental management using a digital twin,"Robust environmental management is based on evidence of ecosystem health and anthropogenic harms gleaned from successful environmental monitoring. Successful monitoring involves the synthesis of observations from a variety of sources to represent a site in its current and past states, the anticipation of future conditions, and communicate the findings to decision-makers for environmental management and other stakeholders; a lack of such synthesis and communication has been identified as a shortcoming in Environmental Impact Assessment. However, a suitable digital platform for this synthesis and communication has not yet been developed. Digital twins, an approach from engineering, may offer a solution with advantages over other approaches traditionally employed in ecosystem monitoring. Here a process and considerations for conducting the use case analysis of a digital twin for environmental monitoring is presented, including identifying users, establishing their requirements, refining use cases based on data practicalities, planning analyses and data/model integrations, and developing the user interface. The process is demonstrated using a case study, developing use cases for an ecological digital twin of a UK Marine Protected Area, which could be generalised as use cases for a digital twin for ecosystem monitoring of a conservation area. Considerations for constructing a digital twin based on these use cases are discussed, including the practicalities of using remotely-sensed biological data; gaps in the scientific, technological and data management capabilities; the role of expertise in adding value beyond simple data collation data; and federation of digital twins.

258,AI-driven optimization of optical imaging and lighting modeling: A framework for landscape visual impact assessment in smart cities,"Landscape Visual Impact Assessment (LVIA) plays a critical role in ensuring that urban and landscape developments align aesthetically and ecologically with their surroundings, particularly in the context of smart cities. Traditional LVIA methods often rely on manual inputs and deterministic algorithms, which are inefficient and prone to errors in large-scale or complex environments. This study proposes an AI-driven framework that integrates advanced computational techniques with SketchUp and V-Ray to address these limitations. The framework leverages artificial intelligence (AI) for terrain analysis, vegetation placement, and optical imaging and lighting modeling, significantly enhancing the accuracy, efficiency, and realism of the LVIA process. Key innovations include the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for precise terrain modeling, clustering algorithms for ecologically valid vegetation distribution, and generative adversarial networks (GANs) for photorealistic rendering with optimized lighting effects. The proposed methodology is validated through a coastal landscape case study, demonstrating a 27% reduction in rendering time and a substantial improvement in elevation accuracy compared to traditional methods. The results also highlight that the AI-driven approach achieves a 92% match with real-world vegetation patterns and significantly improves optical lighting accuracy, ensuring visually harmonious and ecologically sustainable outcomes. By automating resource-intensive tasks and enabling scalability, this framework provides a robust solution for modern urban planning projects, advancing LVIA methodologies to support sustainable, adaptive, and visually compelling smart city landscapes.","['artificial intelligence ', ' environmental modeling ', ' landscape visual impact assessment ', ' lighting modeling ', ' Optical imaging ', ' smart cities']",1.0

An example of such a case is the evaluation of the environmental impacts of products throughout their life cycle. This study bridges the gap in life cycle assessment (LCA) by leveraging AI to predict environmental impacts in agriculture, specifically by using LCA data from one cultivation system to model another. We employed Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) to predict CO2 equivalent emissions for open-field strawberry production, utilizing greenhouse strawberry data. The novelty lies in combining machine learning with LCA to address data scarcity and improve predictive accuracy in agricultural impact assessments. The model was trained with data generated in MATLAB and validated against emissions computed using the Ecoinvent 3.10 database and SimaPro software. Among the three fuzzy inference system (FIS) generation approaches-Fuzzy C-Means (FCM), Subtractive Clustering (SC), and Grid Partitioning (GP) FCM exhibited the highest the accuracy.

262,Integrated life cycle sustainability assessment with future energy mix: A review of methodologies for evaluating the sustainability of multiple power generation technologies development,"One key driver of sustainable goal development is the transition to sustainable electricity resources. The sustainability impact assessment of power production evaluates all potential impacts on society, the environment, and the economy, as well as finds a reasonable solution to shift towards renewable. Given the multitude of quantitative and qualitative methodologies for sustainability analysis, alongside the absence of a unified procedure, selecting an appropriate method poses a significant challenge in conducting this task. Therefore, this paper conducts an extensive review of the methodologies employed for assessing the sustainability of power generation within the future energy mix, as reflected in scientific publications over the past decade (2013–2024). The main objective of this paper is to compare the methodologies and assess their efficiency as suitable tools for analyzing the sustainability of technologies in different geographical regions. The research methodology, following the screening process, selects 102 papers within the study's scope to undergo a critical examination based on sustainability evaluation approaches. It also provides an overview of novel dynamic methods and the application of artificial intelligence in sustainability assessment. The primary findings indicate a deficiency in a standardized approach for sustainability evaluation within electrical technology. In addressing uncertainties in impact assessment due to various parameters, dynamic methods with multiple temporal accuracies are recommended over a static life cycle. The paper includes a case study comparing methods—multi-criteria decision-making, and ranking, scoring—in the Indonesian context.

264,A 6-year-long (2013-2018) high-resolution air quality reanalysis dataset in China based on the assimilation of surface observations from CNEMC,"A 6-year-long high-resolution Chinese air quality reanalysis (CAQRA) dataset is presented in this study obtained from the assimilation of surface observations from the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre (CNEMC) using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS).This dataset contains surface fields of six conventional air pollutants in China (i.e. PM<inf>2.5</inf>, PM<inf>10</inf>, SO<inf>2</inf>, NO<inf>2</inf>, CO, and O<inf>3</inf>) for the period 2013-2018 at high spatial (15km15km) and temporal (1 h) resolutions. This paper aims to document this dataset by providing detailed descriptions of the assimilation system and the first validation results for the above reanalysis dataset. The 5-fold cross-validation (CV) method is adopted to demonstrate the quality of the reanalysis. The CV results show that the CAQRA yields an excellent performance in reproducing the magnitude and variability of surface air pollutants in China from 2013 to 2018 (CV R<sup>2</sup>D 0.52-0.81, CV root mean square error (RMSE)D 0.54 mg=m<sup>3</sup>for CO, and CV RMSED 16.4-39.3 μg=m<sup>3</sup>for the other pollutants on an hourly scale). Through comparison to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reanalysis (CAMSRA) dataset produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF), we show that CAQRA attains a high accuracy in representing surface gaseous air pollutants in China due to the assimilation of surface observations. The fine horizontal resolution of CAQRA also makes it more suitable for air quality studies on a regional scale. The PM2:5 reanalysis dataset is further validated against the independent datasets from the US Department of State Air Quality Monitoring Program over China, which exhibits a good agreement with the independent observations (R<sup>2</sup>= 0.74-0.86 and RMSED 16:8-33.6 μg=m<sup>3</sup>in different cities). Furthermore, through the comparison to satellite-estimated PM<inf>2.5</inf>concentrations, we show that the accuracy of the PM2:5 reanalysis is higher than that of most satellite estimates. The CAQRA is the first high-resolution air quality reanalysis dataset in China that simultaneously provides the surface concentrations of six conventional air pollutants, which is of great value for many studies, such as health impact assessment of air pollution, investigation of air quality changes in China, model evaluation and satellite calibration, optimization of monitoring sites, and provision of training data for statistical or artificial intelligence (AI)-based forecasting. All datasets are freely available at https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00053 (Tang et al., 2020a), and a prototype product containing the monthly and annual means of the CAQRA dataset has also been released at https://doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.00092 (Tang et al., 2020b) to facilitate the evaluation of the CAQRA dataset by potential users.",,1.0
265,AI and the future of human rights in Bangladesh: a call for robust legal and ethical frameworks,"The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technology presents both opportunities and challenges for the protection of human rights in Bangladesh. While AI has the potential to transform and enhance many areas of society, including healthcare, education, and business, it also raises significant ethical and legal questions that require careful consideration. This paper explores the current state of AI technology in Bangladesh and examines the potential impact on human rights, particularly in the areas of privacy, discrimination, and freedom of expression. The paper argues that while AI can be a valuable tool for promoting human rights, it can also exacerbate existing inequalities and create new forms of discrimination. To ensure that AI is used in a way that upholds human rights, the paper calls for the development of robust legal and ethical frameworks to regulate the use of AI technology. The paper proposes several recommendations for achieving this goal, including the establishment of clear ethical guidelines for the development and deployment of AI systems, the creation of a regulatory body to oversee AI technology in Bangladesh, and the use of impact assessments to identify potential risks and harms associated with AI systems. Overall, the paper emphasizes the need for a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to addressing the legal and ethical challenges posed by AI technology in Bangladesh. By taking a proactive and holistic approach, Bangladesh can ensure that AI is developed and used in a way that respects and promotes human rights, rather than undermining them.

266,Extending Multi-Output Methods for Long-Term Aboveground Biomass Time Series Forecasting Using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Accurate aboveground vegetation biomass forecasting is essential for livestock management, climate impact assessments, and ecosystem health. While artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have advanced time series forecasting, a research gap in predicting aboveground biomass time series beyond single values persists. This study introduces RECMO and DirRecMO, two multi-output methods for forecasting aboveground vegetation biomass. Using convolutional neural networks, their efficacy is evaluated across short-, medium-, and long-term horizons on six Kenyan grassland biomass datasets, and compared with that of existing single-output methods (Recursive, Direct, and DirRec) and multi-output methods (MIMO and DIRMO). The results indicate that single-output methods are superior for short-term predictions, while both single-output and multi-output methods exhibit a comparable effectiveness in long-term forecasts. RECMO and DirRecMO outperform established multi-output methods, demonstrating a promising potential for biomass forecasting. This study underscores the significant impact of multi-output size on forecast accuracy, highlighting the need for optimal size adjustments and showcasing the proposed methods’ flexibility in long-term forecasts. Short-term predictions show less significant differences among methods, complicating the identification of the best performer. However, clear distinctions emerge in medium- and long-term forecasts, underscoring the greater importance of method choice for long-term predictions. Moreover, as the forecast horizon extends, errors escalate across all methods, reflecting the challenges of predicting distant future periods. This study suggests advancing hybrid models (e.g., RECMO and DirRecMO) to improve extended horizon forecasting. Future research should enhance adaptability, investigate multi-output impacts, and conduct comparative studies across diverse domains, datasets, and AI algorithms for robust insights.","['convolutional neural network ', ' forecasting accuracy ', ' multi-output methods ', ' time series forecasting ', ' vegetation biomass']",1.0

In the past decade, remote sensing has played an important role in monitoring of plastic pollution in marine and inland water sources and has achieved a series of research results in this field. In this study, a comprehensive review was conducted on the development, opportunities, and challenges of datasets and methods in Marine and Inland Water Plastics Remote Sensing (MIWPRS) monitoring over the past decade, based on the Web of Science (WOS) core database. The results indicated that compared with traditional methods, remote sensing has attracted the attention of scholars due to its advantages. Since 2014, the number of related publications has been increasing year by year, especially in China and the United States, which have achieved tremendous development. The MIWPRS research focus mostly on the use of different satellite remote sensing data and related algorithms to obtain the distribution of plastics in marine and inland water. However, it faces the challenge of lacking subsequent systematic impact assessment models and key pollution prevention measures. In terms of data acquisition, there is a lack of continuous observation models due to the fluidity of marine and inland water. Therefore, MIWPRS has great development opportunities in developing specialized sensors and combining multi-source data with interdisciplinary knowledge such as artificial intelligence (AI) and GIS. It is necessary for us to improve the seasonal migration model of plastics in water and promote the development of MIWPRS towards broader and deeper fields.","['Inland water ', ' Marine ', ' Plastics ', ' Remote sensing']",1.0

There are five key regulatory issues that need to be addressed: (i) data security and protection—measures to cover the “digital health footprints” left unknowingly by patients when they access AI in health services; (ii) data quality—availability of safe and secure data and more open database sources for AI, algorithms, and datasets to ensure equity and prevent demographic bias; (iii) validation of algorithms—mapping of the explainability and causability of the AI system; (iv) accountability—whether this lies with the healthcare professional, healthcare organisation, or the personified AI algorithm; (v) ethics and equitable access—whether fundamental rights of people are met in an ethical manner. Policymakers may need to consider the entire life cycle of AI in healthcare services and the databases that were used for the training of the AI system, along with requirements for their risk assessments to be publicly accessible for effective regulatory oversight. AI services that enhance their functionality over time need to undergo repeated algorithmic impact assessment and must also demonstrate real-time performance. Harmonising regulatory frameworks at the international level would help to resolve cross-border issues of AI in healthcare services.","['Artificial Intelligence ', ' gaps in regulatory frameworks ', ' healthcare services']",0.0
274,"LIFE-CENTERED AI-ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM, AND EPISTEMOLOGIES OF THE SOUTH","This article aims to address the following issues in an interdisciplinary, holistic, and zetetic approach, focused on the perspective of an inclusive, decolonial, sustainable, and democratic AI. It seeks to bring concrete solutions, thus combining the theoretical and practical aspects: how the environmental impact of AI can be reduced, and what are the main challenges in Brazil as a Global South country regarding the protection of fundamental rights of vulnerable populations (indigenous and Afro-descendant); how to promote social justice and social inclusion by combining the concepts of ""design justice,"" ""algorithmic justice,"" ""epistemic justice,"" environmental justice, and digital inclusion through alternative models of AI governance; how an alternative AI governance model can contribute to combining these goals with innovation and technological development, aligning innovation with ethics (""metainnovation"") and responsibility; how the concept of ""human-centered AI"" and the presented framework focused on the protection of fundamental rights and environmental impact can contribute to adequate environmental protection, avoiding an anthropocentric approach and moving towards a more holistic and sustainable understanding. It also seeks to bring reflections and contribute to the academic debate on these topics in Brazil, as there are practically no approaches focused on environmental impacts and the potential threat of AI to all fundamental rights, unlike international documents that already address these issues. Objectives: The aim is to address issues related to AI and its environmental impact, as well as concepts such as ""environmental justice,"" ""environmental racism,"" and ""algorithmic justice,"" which require a critical, interdisciplinary, and contextualized approach, considering the socio-cultural aspect of Brazil and the ""Epistemologies of the South,"" thus having an abolitionist, inclusive, and decolonial ""ethos."" The article aims to contribute primarily to the gap in scientific production on the topics addressed in the Global South, with underrepresentation of Brazil, as well as fundamental rights, as it often focuses only on their individual aspect, forgetting their multiple dimensionality, which also involves collective and social aspects. The goal is to contribute to the effective protection of fundamental rights affected by AI in their multiple dimensionality (individual, collective, and social), as well as to reduce the environmental impact caused by AI, avoiding practices such as so-called ""ethical washing"" or ""greenwashing"" and in favor of AI sustainability. Methodology: The methodology and investigative techniques will combine theoretical research, relating to Michel Foucault's methodology called ""philosophical theater,"" seeking an interdisciplinary and holistic view, and a multifaceted epistemology. Results: The aim was to trace the epistemological, hermeneutic, and methodological foundations for the construction of a framework for the development of one of the most important compliance instruments in the field of artificial intelligence, namely, the AIA – Algorithmic Impact Assessment. The focus is on fundamental rights in their three-dimensional nature, encompassing the direct and indirect environmental impacts caused by AI, as well as considering the socio-cultural particularities of Brazil. Contributions: The article seeks to contribute to the construction of an anthropophagic or tropicalist artificial intelligence, in the sense of developing an inclusive, decolonial, democratic, multicultural, multidimensional AI with a focus on the Epistemologies of the South, post-Eurocentric, capable of addressing the challenges and issues pointed out. The goal is to contribute to the effective protection of the environment, consolidating what is called ""life-centered AI,"" as well as the adequate protection of fundamental rights in this field.","['""fundamental rights by design"" ', ' ""Life-centered AI"" ', ' Rule of Law from conception']",0.0

278,Analysing Selected South African e-Government Failures through the Theory of Unintended Consequences,"The implementation of e-government Information Systems (ISs) is important for digital transformation, facilitation of government policies and improving service delivery to citizens. Like all other technological innovations, implementation of e-governemnt IS requires the evaluation of their ethical implications. This study was aimed at analysing three selected cases from the reports of the Auditor General of South Africa (AGSA) to determine the extent to which these implemented ISs' failures led to unintended consequences from a software engineering ethics perspective. Using Merton's theory of unintended consequences, the study revealed that whilst the implementation of these ISs was a purpose action, ignorance, error and blindness of software practitioners and decision-makers to a hasty implementation of IS are sources of unintended ethical consequences of system failures. Such failures have led to unintended consequences such as unscrupulous people benefiting from the funds, legitimate beneficiaries losing out on benefits and the government losing lots of money. The adoption of an ethics-aware framework for ethical risk identification and impact assessment can significantly improve the prevention of unticipatable and unwanted consequences of government ISs implementation.","['e-government ', ' information system ', ' social implications ', ' software engineering ethics ', ' unintended consequences']",0.0
279,"“Toki”, a light low-cost video system for seabed research: Performance and precision of Tehuelche scallop (Aequipecten tehuelchus) survey estimates in San José Gulf, Argentina","The monitoring of benthic biomass and biodiversity is essential for fisheries management and environmental impact assessments. In the case of commercial species, such as Tehuelche scallop (Aequipecten tehuelchus), accurate information on stock density and distribution is key for regulating the harvest. The standard survey method used to estimate abundance of Tehuelche scallops in San José Gulf, Argentine Patagonia, based on visual counts obtained by divers, is labor-intensive and limited to diving depths. This study introduces a light low-cost video remote system, named “Toki”, for monitoring scallop beds from small boats. Toki consists of a steel pyramidal structure that houses two cameras, capable of capturing georeferenced high-definition images. The performance of Toki for estimating the density and size composition of scallops was evaluated. The results demonstrate that Toki provides efficient and accurate density estimates, with estimation errors that vary with observer experience and environmental factors such as bottom algal cover. The size frequency distribution obtained from Toki aligned well with that of hand-collected samples, making it possible to obtain size-composition information for beds beyond diveable depths. Toki offers advantages in terms of spatial coverage, simple survey logistics and permanent data records. While there are some limitations, such as processing time for image analysis, future developments based on artificial intelligence may overcome these challenges. Toki has the potential to improve the regular monitoring of scallop beds.","['Benthic resource monitoring ', ' Low-cost surveys ', ' Scallop beds ', ' Video remote']",0.0
280,Reform of Environmental Approval Policy for Renewable Energy in Indonesia,"Indonesia faces persistent regulatory barriers in accelerating its renewable energy transition, mainly due to rigid and bureaucratic environmental licensing that ignores the specific characteristics of clean energy projects. This study examines the legal and policy gaps in Indonesia’s environmental licensing framework, using a normative legal approach complemented by case studies and comparative analysis with Germany, Australia, and selected ASEAN countries. The findings reveal three main issues. First, although Indonesia has adopted a risk-based licensing system through the OSS RBA, the country still applies uniform procedures to all projects, failing to distinguish between high-and low-risk activities. It discourages investment and slows the growth of small-scale renewable energy. Second, the principles of prudence and sustainability have not been effectively reflected in policy implementation. There is an urgent need for reforms that align licensing procedures with project risks, strengthen public participation, ensure protection for vulnerable groups, and leverage digital technologies for greater transparency. Third, international comparisons show that countries such as Germany, Australia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos have successfully accelerated clean energy adoption by implementing risk-based regulations, simplifying procedures, offering financial incentives, and improving intergovernmental coordination. Based on these insights, the study recommends that Indonesia reform its environmental licensing policies to be more adaptive, transparent, and proportionate to project risks, thus supporting legal certainty, ecological justice, and a sustainable energy transition.","['Environmental Approvals ', ' Policy Reform ', ' Renewable Energy']",0.0

282,Advancing Sustainable Water Management in Southern Italy Through Integrated Hydrological Modeling and Earth Observation,"In water-scarce regions, effective water resource management is crucial for performing sustainable agriculture. Scientists and decision-makers increasingly exploit the coupled use of hydrological and crop models to address resource conservation and productivity challenges. While emphasizing crop system performance and environmental impact assessment, equal attention is needed for ensuring sustainable crop production and effective water management. In response to these needs, the Italian Space Agency (ASI), within the framework of the I4DP-SCIENCE programme, supports the collaborative THETIS project (EarTH Observation for the Early forecasT of Irrigation needS; Agreement n. 2023-52-HH.0). THETIS aims at developing a spatial decision support system that integrates hydrologic and crop growth models with advanced Earth observation (EO) products, Artificial Intelligence, and a WEBGIS interface. Starting activities focus on processing tomatoes, which are highly water-demanding. A synergic data exchange between models is established to provide estimates of water needs before, at the beginning, and during the irrigation season with periodic updates. An essential component of the project entails producing estimated time series of root zone soil moisture, crucial for initializing the AquaCrop model and evaluating the water balance within the designated fields. To accomplish this task, in the THETIS project a joint use of the daily basin-scale hydrological model DREAM and the physically based Soil Moisture Analytical Relationship (SMAR) model forming a Soil Water Balance (SWB) module is proposed. This paper provides a brief contextualization of the THETIS project focusing on the need for reliable estimations of soil moisture dynamics. To this end a review of the existing application of SMAR model is presented. It helped to draw remarks about the main challenges and perspectives of use of the model within a context where soil moisture may be strongly influenced by irrigation volumes and agricultural practices.","['Hydrological model ', ' Satellite retrieval ', ' Soil moisture ', ' Water needs']",0.0
283,Aligning artificial intelligence with climate change mitigation,"There is great interest in how the growth of artificial intelligence and machine learning may affect global GHG emissions. However, such emissions impacts remain uncertain, owing in part to the diverse mechanisms through which they occur, posing difficulties for measurement and forecasting. Here we introduce a systematic framework for describing the effects of machine learning (ML) on GHG emissions, encompassing three categories: computing-related impacts, immediate impacts of applying ML and system-level impacts. Using this framework, we identify priorities for impact assessment and scenario analysis, and suggest policy levers for better understanding and shaping the effects of ML on climate change mitigation.",,0.0

285,A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE LEGAL FRAMEWORKS FOR SIA AND EIA IN MALAYSIA,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Social Impact Assessment (SIA) are the primary assessment tools used to generate information on the likely impacts of a project on all aspects of the environment and society, aiding the decision-making process to achieve sustainable development. While EIA is mainly concerned with assessing the potential environmental consequences of a proposed development, SIA evaluates the potential social consequences. These two mechanisms play a crucial role in promoting resilient and sustainable development in Malaysia. The legal framework for EIA has been enforced since 1988 and evolved through several legislations, including the Environmental Quality (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act A1441), very much earlier compared to the SIA legal framework, which was introduced in 2017 by virtue of the Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Act 2017(Act A1522). Thus, this paper aims to analyse the legal framework of both assessment mechanisms, employing the qualitative method of library research, content and comparative analysis. The result shows that the EIA framework is more comprehensive and practical and is an effective model for the improvement of the SIA framework in Malaysia. © 2023 Malaysian Institute Of Planners.

286,Appraisal of environmental impacts and mitigation measures through mathematical matrices,"Interaction matrices are widely used in environmental impact assessments (EIAs). However this technique is considered an illustrative approach, since its analytical power is deemed to be insufficient for effectively handling complex decision-making. It can be argued that the misuse of interaction matrices has (in some instances) contributed to flawed EIAs, which have been deliberately misrepresentative and have been used for endorsement of projects. Consequently, an alternative for better EIAs in the short term is to enhance the matrix approach, so that a more rigorous evaluation of impacts can be achieved. The approach presented here is based upon mathematical matrices to determine the significance of impacts; specifically it encompasses the use of minimum link matrices, interpretative structural models and exponential and linear equations. This method allows users to systematically weight all possible cause-effect interactions and pathways, and to consider primary and secondary impacts identified in a matrix. Consequently, the approach increases the effectiveness and rigor of matrices in handling complex data and predicting environmental impacts in a strict and traceable way.", Ecological impacts; EIA; Environmental impact assessment; Highways; Mexico; Significance of impacts,1.0

288,"Enviroscore: normalization, weighting, and categorization algorithm to evaluate the relative environmental impact of food and drink products","A 5-scale label that relativizes the environmental impact of a given product referred to the impact of the European food basket is proposed. It was developed based on the Product Environmental Footprint methodology with the following stepwise approach. First, a set of normalization and weighting factors were defined to aggregate all the environmental impact categories into a single dimensionless index referred to as the European food basket, coined the European Food Environmental Footprint Single Index (EFSI). Next, the effectiveness of the EFSI index was evaluated by assessing the distribution of the EFSI results on 149 hypothetical food items and comparing it with the results obtained with EC Single Score. Finally, the thresholds to translate the EFSI index into the 5-scale Enviroscore (A, B, C, D, and E) were established and validated using the Delphi method. Results indicated that both, Enviroscore and EFSI, were able to account for impact variability between and within food products. Differences on the final score were observed due to the type of products (vegetables vs. animal products), the country of origin and the mean of transportation. Regarding country of origin, results indicated that differences in water stress impact category were better captured by the EFSI index (r = 0.624) than by the EC Single Score (r = 0.228). Finally, good agreement achieved with the Delphi method (weighted Kappa 0.642; p = 0.0025), ensures the acceptability of the Enviroscore. In conclusion, this study developed a method to communicate environmental impact assessment in a front-of-packaging label. © 2022, The Author(s).", ,0.0
289,An Analysis of Strategic Environmental Assessment Legislation and Regulations in African Countries,"In light of the scarcity of literature exploring Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) legislation, this paper aims to analyse how national legislation and regulations in Africa include key principles for effective SEA. To achieve this aim, a content analysis of Environmental Assessment (EA) legal arrangements was conducted. Findings reveal that most countries do not have legal provisions for SEA at strategic levels. However, some countries have formal requirements for Environmental Impact Assessment at specific strategic levels. Such requirements may be attributed to an implicit recognition of the need of EA for specific strategic actions. Countries with legal and regulatory requirements for SEA showed varied degrees of conformity with process principles, screening, scoping, impact assessment and documentation strengths, but there are weaknesses in monitoring. Further findings echo a warning as none of the legal arrangements were fully adequate. This paper concludes with recommendations to improve legislation and strengthen SEA practice in Africa. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.", African countries; legislation; performance; regulations; Strategic environmental assessment,1.0
290,Use of satellite imagery as environmental impact assessment tool: A case study from the NW Egyptian Red Sea coastal zone,"Knowledge and detecting impacts of human activities on the coastal ecosystem is an essential management requirement and also very important for future and proper planning of coastal areas. Moreover, documentation of these impacts can help in increasing public awareness about side effects of unsustainable practices. Analysis of multidate remote sensing data can be used as an effective tool in environmental impact assessment (EIA). Being synoptic and frequent in coverage, multidate data from Landsat and other satellites provide a reference record and bird's eye viewing to the environmental situation of the coastal ecosystem and the associated habitats. Furthermore, integration of satellite data with field observations and background information can help in decision if a certain activity has caused deterioration to a specific habitat or not. The present paper is an attempt to utilize remote sensing data for assessment impacts of some human activities on the major sensitive habitats of the NW Egyptian Red Sea coastal zone, definitely between Ras Gemsha and Safaga.

291,Catalytic hydrogenation of agricultural residues to green diesel: Process optimization with FeMo/Al2O3 catalyst,"Limitations of converting agricultural residues into green diesel include high production costs, particularly for catalysts and hydrogen, and technical viability. Safety risks also arise from high-pressure hydrogenation, requiring precautions and specialized equipment. This research evaluates green diesel from agricultural residues via hydrogenation with FeMo/Al2O3 under optimized conditions. Utilizing FeMo/Al2O3 heterogeneous catalysts, the process demonstrates high precision and efficiency. The catalytic hydrogenation reactors, specifically designed for converting cellulosic biomass into green diesel, ensure both effectiveness and safety, particularly when managing the high pressures and temperatures required. Notably, the highest yield occurs at a specific temperature, with returns decreasing when operating beyond this optimal temperature range. Outcomes derived from experimentation and MATLAB data analysis, exploring catalyst efficiency, green diesel production, catalyst stability, reusability, techno-economic assessment, cost and environmental impact assessment, and life cycle analysis. Petroleum diesel has the highest emissions at 0.88 kg CO2/MJ, followed by biodiesel at 0.8 kg CO2/MJ, and green diesel with the lowest emissions at 0.1 kg CO2/MJ. This indicates that green diesel emits the least amount of greenhouse gases, with petroleum diesel emitting nearly nine times more than green diesel. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", Agricultural residues; catalytic hydrogenation; FeMo/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> catalysts; green diesel; greenhouse gas emissions; life cycle assessment,0.0

294,GIS-based multi-criteria railway design with spatial environmental considerations,"Railway design is complex and closely linked to environmental concerns. To solve this problem, a two-stage method considering three categories of environmental factors (topography, ecology and geology) is proposed and demonstrated by being applied to a real-world case in China. The first stage focuses on environmental impact assessment. An elevation accessibility map is generated by determining railway spatially-reachable ranges. Then, the three categories of environmental factors are divided into 12 sub-factors and their spatial relations with railways are analyzed using a GIS. After that, an environmental suitability map is produced by combining the influences of these sub-factors with a multi-criteria analytical hierarchy process. The second stage focuses on automated railway design. The study area is first narrowed based on the two maps to determine feasible search spaces. Then, a distance transform algorithm is customized to search for railway alignments. During the search, a multi-criteria tournament decision method is integrated to optimize alignment solutions. Lastly, the application results of our two-stage method are analyzed. The outcomes reveal that the two environment-related maps provide effective descriptions of the study area.

295,Understanding and minimizing environmental impacts of the Belt and Road Initiative,"China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) sets to create connections and build infrastructure across Eurasia, Asia, and parts of the African continent in its initial phase and is the largest infrastructure project of all time. Any infrastructure project on this scale will necessarily pass through ecofragile regions and key biodiversity areas (KBAs). This creates an imperative to identify possible areas of impact and probable effects on conservation values to facilitate adaptive planning and to mitigate, minimize, or avoid impacts. Using the highest resolution route maps of the BRI available, I overlaid the proposed road and rail routes on KBAs, protected areas, and predicted biodiversity hotspots for over 4138 animal and 7371 plant species. I also assessed the relationship between the proposed route with the distribution of mines across BRI countries and the proportion of deforestation and forest near routes. Infrastructure, especially mining, was clustered near the proposed route; thus, construction and development along the route may increase the size and number of mines. Up to 15% of KBAs were within 1 km of proposed railways. Thus, planned and probable development along the routes may pose a significant risk to biodiversity, especially because the majority of KBAs are unprotected. Many biodiversity hotspots for different taxa were near the route. These hotspots varied between taxa, making systematic management and environmental impact assessments an effective strategy for at least some taxa. A combination of planning and mitigation strategies will likely be necessary to protect the most important areas for biodiversity proximal to development, especially in currently unprotected KBAs and other regions that need protection. A fuller assessment of trade-offs between conservation and other values will be necessary to make good decisions for each project and site being developed, including potentially modifying parts of the route to minimize impacts. Modification or foregoing of infrastructure may be needed if stakeholders consider the conservation costs too high. © 2019 The Authors.

296,Environmental trade-offs of relay-cropping winter cover crops with soybean in a maize-soybean cropping system,"Winter camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz] and field pennycress [Thlaspi arvense L.] are oilseed feedstocks that can be employed as winter-hardy cover crops in the current cropping systems in the U.S. upper Midwest. In addition to provide multiple ecosystem services, they can be a further source of income for the farmer. However, using these cover crops is a new agricultural practice that has only been studied recently. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the environmental performance of a maize [Zea mays L.]-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cropping system with different winter cover crops - camelina, pennycress, and rye (Secale cereale L.) - in the U.S. upper Midwest. Field experiments were carried out from 2016 to 2017 (2-year maize-soybean sequence) at three locations: Morris (Minnesota), Ames (Iowa), and Prosper (North Dakota). The environmental impact assessment was carried out using a “cradle-to-gate” life cycle assessment methodology. Four impact categories were assessed: global warming potential (GWP), eutrophication, soil erosion, and soil organic carbon (SOC) variation. Two functional units (FU) were selected: (1) 1 ha year−1, and (2) $1 net margin. When expressed with the FU ha yr−1, across the three locations cover crops had (a) lower eutrophication potential and water soil erosion, and (b) lower GWP if the cover crop was not fertilized with nitrogen. Camelina and pennycress were more effective than rye in reducing soil losses, while the three cover crops provided similar results for eutrophication potential. The results for the SOC variation were mixed, but the sequence with rye had the best performance at all locations. When expressed with the FU $ net margin, sequences including camelina and pennycress were overall the worst sequences in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient and soil losses. This negative performance was mainly due to the seed yield reduction in the second year of the sequence for both the main cash crop (soybean) and the relayed-cover crop compared with the conventional sequence maize-soybean. Such result led to a lower net margin per hectare in the sequences including camelina and pennycress when compared with the control. The results of this study suggest that the introduction of camelina and pennycress as winter-hardy cover crops has a strong potential for reducing the environmental impacts of the maize-soybean rotation. However, a field management optimization of these cover crops in a relay-cropping system is needed to make them a sustainable agricultural practice. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd", Field pennycress; Life cycle assessment; Nutrient losses; Relay-cropping; Soil erosion; Winter camelina,1.0
297,The effectiveness of EIA as an instrument for environmental governance: Reflecting on 25 years of EIA practice in the Netherlands and the UK,"The European Union (EU) Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive which was introduced some 25 years ago has had a major impact on decision-making practices in EU member states. In the professional literature, this impact has mostly been discussed under the heading of ""effectiveness"", with an emphasis being given in particular to procedural elements. The extent to which EIA has contributed to objectives, such as raising environmental awareness and leading to an incorporation of environmental values in decision-making has only been rarely investigated. This paper reflects on these latter two aspects of EIA effectiveness in two EU member states; the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Empirical evidence was compiled mainly on the basis of a comprehensive literature review and online surveys with EIA professionals in both countries. Our results indicate that overall the instrument is about equally effective in both countries with regards to the incorporation of environmental concerns in decision-making. As both countries have different governance mechanisms, further research is needed on why perceived effectiveness does not differ more. © 2012 Imperial College Press.", context; effectiveness; Environmental Impact Assessment; governance; the Netherlands; the United Kingdom,1.0
298,A practical method for environmental impact assessment audits,"A nine-step procedure for auditing environmental impact assessments (EIA) identifies the actual impacts that appear to result from a project and uses simple field and office techniques to determine whether those impacts were properly characterized in the EIA. This is more practical than audit procedures commonly described in the literature, which view EIA predictions as scientific hypotheses to be evaluated through rigorous statistical tests and experimental controls. The proposed method can be thought of as an 'impacts-backward' approach, in contrast to the scientific or 'predictions-forward' method. Application of the procedure to EIAs for coal mines in the south-central United States found a need for: (1) more effective scoping of small projects, to identify project- and site-specific impact issues and (2) more complete discussion of mitigation measures, including exactly who is responsible for ensuring mitigation, and why the proposed mitigation is expected to be successful.

299,"Performance evaluation on bond, durability, micro-structure, cost effectiveness and environmental impacts of fly ash cenosphere based structural lightweight concrete","The production of huge fly ash waste from thermal power plants and gradual depletion of natural aggregates due to their high consumption in concrete making are two major threats to the sustainability of the environment. The strategic utilization of this waste as a replacement of natural aggregate in production of concrete can solve both the problems simultaneously. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the performance of structural lightweight concrete (LWC) containing fly ash cenosphere (FAC), a by-product of fly ash, in order to check its suitability for construction. In this study, one control concrete mix, i.e., without FAC, and other ten concrete mixes utilizing FAC as the replacement of natural fine aggregate (NFA) at the increment of 20% and with/without superplasticizer (SP) are prepared. The Mechanical properties (compressive and bond strength), durability aspects (sulphuric acid, magnesium sulphate and sodium chloride resistance) and the microstructural characteristics from X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscope analyses of these mixes are evaluated. Moreover, the environmental impact assessment and cost-effective analysis are also conducted. From this investigation, it is found that the structural LWC can be produced by utilizing high volume FAC with/without SP with the acceptable mechanical and durability performances. Further, the concrete with 80 % FAC and SP is found to be optimum having compressive strength of 32.59 MPa, which satisfies M25 grade concrete as per IS 456 (2000), meets ACI 213 (2014) requirements of structural LWC and has also acceptable durability properties. The microstructure studies have also supported the strength and durability results of these mixes. Moreover, these mixes are found to be cost effective and environmentally friendly. Hence, structural LWC prepared with a high volume of FAC and SP can be recommended for construction, which reduces the cost and environmental impacts significantly and preserves natural resources for the future generations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"," Bond strength, Cost effectiveness; Durability properties; Environmental impacts; Fly ash cenosphere; Microstructural characteristics, Structural lightweight concrete",0.0
300,Environmental impact assessment of development projects improved by merging species distribution and habitat connectivity modelling,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA)is performed to limit potential impacts of development projects on species and ecosystem functions. However, the methods related to EIA actually pay little attention to the landscape-scale effects of development projects on biodiversity. In this study we proposed a methodological framework to more properly address the landscape-scale impacts of a new stadium project in Lyon (France)on two representative mammal species exemplary for the endemic fauna, the red squirrel and the Eurasian badger. Our approach combined species distribution model using Maxent and landscape functional connectivity model using Graphab at two spatial scales to assess habitat connectivity before and after development project implementation. The development project had a negative impact on landscape connectivity: overall habitat connectivity (PC index)decreased by −6.8% and −1.8% and the number of graph components increased by +60.0% and +17.6% for the red squirrel and the European badger respectively, because some links that formerly connected habitat patches were cut by the development project. Changes affecting landscape structure and composition emphasized the need to implement appropriate avoidance and reduction measures. Our methodology provides a useful tool both for EIA studies at each step of the way to support decision-making in landscape conservation planning. The method could be also developed in the design phase to compare the effectiveness of different avoidance or mitigation measures and resize them if necessary to maximize habitat connectivity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd", Conservation planning; Eurasian badger; Graph theory; Habitat connectivity; Maximum entropy modelling; Red squirrel,1.0
301,Environmental impact assessment with multimedia spatial information systems,"The environmental impact assessment (EIA) process involves the consideration of large amounts of data comprising several variables and phenomena, with complex interrelationships varying in space and time. The potential of spatial information systems (SIS) has been increasingly realized for use in EIA, although they are used only for the production and presentation of maps, without the exploration of their ability to analyze spatial data. The integration of multi-media with SIS may contribute to the development of more realistic and effective environmental decision support systems  The incorporation of images, video, and sound within SIS might increase their ability to deal with the multiple aspects of environmental problems. The concepts beyond the creation of an environmental multimedia SIS are presented and the associated capabilities and application issues are reviewed. -from Authors", ,1.0
302,"Number of times recycled and its effect on the recyclability, fluidity and tensile properties of polypropylene injection molded parts","The ease with which modern plastics can be injection molded makes them very suitable for the production of many different products and, today, plastics are often used as substitutes for metal. Polypropylene (PP) is one of the most widely used thermoplastics globally since it is very useful, cost-effective and flexible for molding. However, the amount of harm to the environment caused by plastic waste has become phenomenal and the recycling of plastics has become a serious aspect of environmental protection. PP, as the most commonly used plastic material, was selected for use in this study. It has a melt flow index of 15 g/min and its recyclability, fluidity, and physical properties, as well as manufacturing conditions, were explored in relation to the number of times the material could be recycled (TR). A cavity pressure sensor was used to measure the viscosity index of the recycled plastic after multiple cycles of plasticizing and injection, part molding, scrap-recycling, and crushing. A paperclip-shaped test specimen was used to determine PP fluidity and crystallinity of specimens with different TRs. Tensile tests were used to detect differences in the tensile strength between specimens made from Raw-PP and recycled PP. The results showed that PP that had been recycled several times had a higher melt flow index, material fluidity, melting peak area, crystallinity, crystallization rate, and crystallization temperature. Repeated injection and recycling of the material had reduced the length of the molecular chains and broadened the molecular weight distribution. This improved the fluidity and increased crystallinity. The increase in fluidity made cavity filling easier, reducing the cavity pressure as well as the viscosity index. The results of this study showed that the recycling of the PP could improve the physical properties of the products to a degree and also went some way to further the benefits of a circular economy. The recycling of injection-molded PP material can be added to renewable energy technologies and used in environmental impact assessment. © 2021 by the authors.

303,From environmental impact assessment to environmental design and planning,"This article reviews the strengths and weaknesses of Environmental Impact Assessment, or as we prefer Environmental Assessment (EA), as a tool for environmental management. EA has had many roles: a passive role of advising decision-makers, a more active role of mitigating impacts through design changes, an important educative role, and a community empowerment role. While EA has had a pivotal role in the development and evolution of environmental management in Australia and elsewhere, and remains an important tool, it is no longer at the cutting edge. By and large there has been far too much focus on procedural aspects of EA to the detriment of the substantive purpose of EA. We suggest in this article that we should steadily be moving beyond narrow conceptions of EA to incorporate the many valuable perspectives and techniques that have evolved as part of the collective experience of conducting environmental assessments directly into project design, land use planning and policy development activities. EA concepts can be more effectively integrated into design processes through decision-scoping and can have a more effective role in planning when environmental plans incorporate performance criteria and standards into plans. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", ,1.0
304,Strategic environmental assessment can help solve environmental impact assessment failures in developing countries,"The current trend of industrialization and urbanization in developing nations has a huge impact on anthropogenic and natural ecosystems. Pollution sources increase with the expansion of cities and cause contamination of water, air and soil. The absence of urban environmental planning and management strategies has resulted in greater concern for future urban development. This paper advocates the adoption of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) as a means to achieve sustainable development in developing countries. It investigates project-level environmental impact assessment (EIA) and its limitations. The exploration of SEA and its features are addressed. The effective implementation of SEA can create a roadmap for sustainable development. In many developing countries, the lack of transparency and accountability and ineffective public participation in the development of the policy, plan and program (PPP) would be mitigated by the SEA process. Moreover, the proactive and broadly based characteristics of SEA would benefit the institutional development of the PPP process, which is rarely experienced in many developing countries. The paper also explores the prospects for SEA and its guiding principles in developing countries. Finally, the paper calls for a coordinated effort between all government, nongovernment and international organizations involved with PPPs to enable developing countries to pursue a path of sustainable development through the development and application of strategic environmental assessment. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

305,Quantitative assessment of fish larvae community composition in spawning areas using metabarcoding of bulk samples,"Accurate assessment of larval community composition in spawning areas is essential for fisheries management and conservation but is often hampered by the cryptic nature of many larvae, which renders them difficult to identify morphologically. Metabarcoding is a rapid and cost-effective method to monitor early life stages for management and environmental impact assessment purposes but its quantitative capability is under discussion. We compared metabarcoding with traditional morphological identification to evaluate taxonomic precision and reliability of abundance estimates, using 332 fish larvae from multinet hauls (0–50 m depth) collected at 14 offshore sampling sites in the Irish and Celtic seas. To improve quantification accuracy (relative abundance estimates), the amount of tissue for each specimen was standardized and mitochondrial primers (12S gene) with conserved binding sites were used. Relative family abundance estimated from metabarcoding reads and morphological assessment were positively correlated, as well as taxon richness (RS = 0.81, P = 0.007) and diversity (RS = 0.90, P = 0.002). Spatial patterns of community composition did not differ significantly between metabarcoding and morphological assessments. Our results show that DNA metabarcoding of bulk tissue samples can be used to monitor changes in fish larvae abundance and community composition. This represents a feasible, efficient, and faster alternative to morphological methods that can be applied to terrestrial and aquatic habitats. © 2021 The Authors.

Based on the four main stages of urban planning (i.e. outline formation, planning research, planning drafting, and planning approval), the main technical processes of ecological space optimization and management for PEIA were constructed, including the main tasks of spatial element analysis and basic scheme formation, analysis of the ecological environment and spatial coordination, evaluation of the impact of planning on spatial utilization, and recommendations for spatial optimization and management. The technical processes were also applied to the Environmental Impact Assessment of Shanghai Baoshan District Master Plan. The results showed that by incorporating ecological protection red lines and river networks as well as adding new ecological nodes and corridors, the total optimized ecological space in Baoshan District increased from 65.74 km2 to 121.84 km2, accounting for 40.4% of the regional land area, meeting the requirements of Shanghai Urban Master Plan (2016-2040), which proposed that by 2040, Baoshan District's ecological land would account for 40% of the land area. In conclusion, urban PEIA could further optimize the ecological spatial pattern in terms of major ecological environmental issues and regional environmental demands based on the ecological space of urban planning, and provide effective means to promote new urbanization and ecological civilization construction in China. © The Author(s) 2022.", ecological space; highly urbanized areas; planning environmental impact assessment; spatial management; spatial optimization,1.0
307,Environmental impact assessment of different design schemes of an industrial ecosystem,"Industrial ecosystem is an important approach for sustainable development. In an industrial ecosystem, a group of industries are inter-connected through mass and energy exchanges for mutual benefits. However, some mass and energy exchange activities may cause unexpected environmental impacts. Therefore, it is vital to evaluate the environmental impacts of the symbiosis in order to provide a clear guidance for the decision-makers and stakeholders. The agro-chemical complex in the Lower Mississippi River Corridor with thirteen chemical and petrochemical industries emits huge amount of carbon dioxide. A bi-level design methodology is used to reconfigure this complex for utilizing surplus carbon dioxide. By using a superstructure-based approach, a new design scheme for this industrial ecosystem is proposed. In this paper, an LCA-type environmental impact assessment of different design schemes for this complex is conducted using the software TRACI, a tool developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). This analysis compares various environmental impacts of different designs and identifies the potential trade-offs in different environmental impact categories. This information provides deep insight about the environmental sustainability of industrial ecosystems and facilitates the development of the most eco-effective symbiosis for recycle, reuse and resource conservation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

308,Geomechanical properties of gas hydrate-bearing sediments in Shenhu Area of the South China Sea,"It is essential to understand the in-situ geomechanical properties of natural gas hydrate-bearing reservoirs for hydrate drilling, the design of reservoir stimulation and production schemes, geologic disaster prevention, and environmental impact assessment. In this way, it serves as the basis for the development and utilization of gas hydrate resources. In 2016, the Guangzhou Marine Geological Survey conducted the fourth natural gas hydrate drilling (Expedition GMGS4) in the north of the South China Sea, during which the effective stress of gas hydrate-bearing reservoirs in the study area was ascertained and gas hydrate-bearing pressure cores were collected. The effective stress was determined to be 700–800 kPa by in-situ piezocone penetration tests. The saturation, permeability, and shear strength of gas hydrates in the pressure core samples were measured under the in-situ stress state using the shipboard multi-sensor core logger (MSCL), pressure core analysis and transfer system (PCATS), and PCATS Triaxial system. Based on this, the distribution characteristics and the relationship of the permeability and gas hydrate saturation of the gas hydrate-bearing reservoirs were explored. Furthermore, the effects of effective stress and gas hydrate saturation on shear strength of gas hydrate-bearing clayey-silt sediments were mainly analyzed, as well as the stress–strain characteristics of gas hydrate-bearing sediments. The results are as follows: (i) the gas hydrate saturation and reservoir permeability in the study area are 0.7%–55% and 10−3–10−1mD, respectively, indicating low-permeability reservoirs; (ii) the gas hydrate saturation and reservoir permeability have obvious anisotropy in horizontal and vertical directions; (iii) the undrained shear strength of gas hydrate-bearing sediments is 0.24–0.52 MPa, and the shear strength of fine-grained sediments is more sensitive to the changes of in-situ stress. In the case that deviatoric stress continues increasing, micro-fractures may occur inside gas hydrate-bearing sediments, and this can lead to drastic changes in the strength of gas hydrate-bearing reservoirs. Therefore, it is necessary to take into account the effects of micro-fractures in gas hydrate-bearing reservoirs on engineering safety during long-term hydrate production. © 2021 The Authors", Effective stress; Natural gas hydrate; Permeability anisotropy; Pressure core; Shear strength,1.0
309,Environmental impact assessment of shipping on Arctic marine ecosystems based on Multi-Agent System simulation; [基于 MAS 模拟的北极航运对生态环境的影响评估],"Maritime transportation activity in the Arctic is increasing, which is due to global warming and decline of Arctic sea ice, posing a threat to local atmosphere, marine organisms, etc. From the perspective of ecological protection, potential impact of marine transportation in the Arctic on marine organisms is evaluated using multi-agent system (MAS) simulation through a case of ship-based oil spills. Multiple regression analysis is then used to compare impacts of factors. Considering the interactions between Arctic shipping and Arctic marine organisms and that MAS is shown to be effective to handle such interactions, MAS is used for modeling together with simulation. The biological effects model of Arctic shipping is combined with Arctic maritime transportation model, ship-based oil spill model and oil spreading model. The two indicators of environmental impact assessment are loss rate of Arctic marine organisms within the oiled area (the proportion of the population within the oiled area that gets into contact directly with the oil spills) and oil area. The results show that, taking Arctic Northeast Passage as an example, when vessel traffic in the Arctic is low, oil spill accidents caused by tankers affects 1. 1%~1. 4% of Arctic marine organisms during navigation period. The loss rate can rise to 2. 1%~2. 7% with doubled vessel traffic. It also shows that oil life days have the greatest impact on the loss of Arctic marine organisms, followed by navigation period. Arctic vessel traffic ranks third among all factors. Oil types come last. The variation of loss rate of Arctic marine organisms under different oil types is mainly due to the difference in oil area. The results are expected to help evaluate the impact of Arctic shipping on Arctic marine environment and improve the understanding of emergency preparedness and response of maritime accidents in the Arctic. © 2023 World Regional Studies.

310,Institutional Analysis on Stakeholder Participation in China's Environmental Impact Assessment: A State–Attribution–Motivation–Interaction–Reengineering Framework,"Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) play an essential role in promoting sustainable development by coordinating and balancing economic, social, and environmental objectives. As one of its mandatory components, stakeholder participation (SP) is designed to contribute to the implementation of EIAs as well as the relevant decision making with regard to a proposed project. Stakeholder participation ranges from being a token process to being a very effective practice; it has been criticized as ineffective in an authoritarian context. This research investigates the SP process of project EIAs via 3 case studies. A developed State–Attribution–Motivation– Interaction–Reengineering (SAMIR) framework is used to identify the causes, results, and substantive changes among 3 main actors or organizations: citizens, enterprises, and local governments. It demonstrates that the endogenous interactions among 3 institutional pillars—regulative, normative, and cognitive—are the root of institutional change. Initial cognitive actions can lead to regulative and normative social institutional change, thus stimulating the reengineering of the institutions’ system relevant to SP. To facilitate institutional innovation and reengineering of SP with Chinese characteristics, it is of crucial importance to deeply reform and detail institutional design, to promote the SP governance structural change from a closed model to an open model. In order for such change to occur, the following are recommended: Move from government to governance, have institutional innovations follow the mass line, pay more attention to fairness rather than focusing on efficiency, and in addition, disseminate science and promote actors’ communication. The benefits and advantages are instruments to overcome the “not in my backyard” (NIMBY) impact. And reengineering government structural change from and administration paradigm to a governance paradigm plays a primary role.

311,A field-scale long-term study on radionuclide transport through weathered granites at a site in southern China,"A regional strategy for safety disposal of low- and intermediate-level radioactive wastes (LILW) has been implemented in China to protect humans and the environment. A joint onsite and laboratory investigation was conducted for a field site in southern China to assess the probability for safe disposal of LILW, which requires the understanding of long-term radionuclide transport behaviors under field conditions. This study presents the field-scale modeling of radionuclide transport through weathered granites for a conservative, a weakly sorbing and a strongly sorbing tracer by incorporating laboratory and field data. The field-scale radionuclide transport model was developed on the basis of a validated long-term groundwater flow model and field-measured dispersion coefficient, as well as laboratory-characterized strontium and cesium distribution coefficients in the weathered granites. The model was then used to perform the long-term transport prediction and risk assessment of radionuclide pollution for both the natural site setting and the graded site setting. Model simulation reveals that the numerical sensitivities of calculated concentrations are tracer dependent and changing with time. The conservative radionuclide is most sensitive to changes in hydraulic conductivity (K) while slightly sensitive to changes in effective porosity (φ), specific yield (μ) and longitudinal dispersion coefficient (DL), indicating advection is the main transport process of conservative radionuclide. The weakly and strongly sorbing tracers, on the other hand, are most sensitive to changes in the distribution coefficient (Kd) and less sensitive to changes in the rest of model parameters, revealing that sorption is the main process for controlling the transport of sorbing tracers. A conservative radionuclide plume moves at an average velocity of about 54 m/a, which is too fast to be considered as safe disposal under the natural site setting. However, the plume of the conservative radionuclide could be slowed down to a velocity around 5.3 m/a due to the reduction of the hydraulic gradient under the graded site setting. Therefore, the conservative radioactive wastes could be disposed at the mid-eastern part of the site under the graded site setting because the transport path has been prolonged and thus no conservative radionuclides could migrate out of the site in a reasonable timeframe. For the sorbing tracers, however, results of the computed transport distance are 40 and 2 m at 500 years, respectively. Therefore, they can be disposed safely at the site under both natural and graded site settings. This study provides an insight to the field-scale long-term behaviors of radionuclide transport. The integrated modeling method presented in this study is most useful for the environmental impact assessment of the site conditions relevant to the safe disposal of hazardous wastes. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", Disposal of LILW; Environmental impact assessment; Field-scale solute transport model; Numerical flow modeling; Radionuclide transport,1.0
312,A risk model for predicting the effects of lake-side development on wildfowl populations,"The lack of quantitative analysis and general scientific rigour in environmental impact assessment (EIA) is well documented. While reasons for this may include political and economic factors, the lack of high-level statistical knowledge and skills in environmental consultancies probably contributes to the problem, particularly with regard to ecological studies. This paper develops a simple model for wintering wildfowl populations that predicts different levels of risk from lake-side development. The aim was to create a model that could be used easily and quickly by consultants, is readily understandable for developers and various groups associated with the planning process, with explicit assumptions that can be criticised, and predictions that can be tested with post-development audits. The model is used in a case study. The basic parameters of the model are (i) average wildfowl abundance on lakes before development, (ii) maximum potential density of wildfowl across lakes (Kmax) before development, and (iii) reduction in lake area suitable for wildfowl after development. The model includes abundance-area relationships that are useful for highlighting the importance of particular lakes at a site. In the case study, abundance-area relationships focused attention on two lakes with thick charophyte beds which supported higher than expected numbers of pochard and coot given their size. As well as being robust (confidence limits are calculated), the model's predictions are quantitative and testable, making it possible to compare the predictions with on-going post-development monitoring of wildfowl population levels. The predictions rely on the effectiveness of path screening, and post-development monitoring can suggest where screening should be strengthened if the model's predictions are not met. Similarly, if other assumptions in the model are not met by the development, appropriate action can be implemented. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, the prevailing teaching profiles reveal a limited EIA vision, not addressing the minimum necessary for understanding EIA as an environmental policy instrument. The weaknesses highlighted indicate that EIA teaching may be negatively influencing EIA practice and vice versa, creating a vicious cycle. Thus, this highlights the urgency for improving EIA teaching in Brazil, which should contribute to Brazilian EIA practice. © 2022", Engenharia Ambiental; Environmental Engineering; Environmental Licensing; Ingeniería Ambiental; Licencia Ambiental; Licenciamento Ambiental; Perfil de enseñanza; Perfil de ensino; plan de enseñanza; plano de ensino; teaching curriculum; Teaching profile,1.0

315,Effects and drawbacks of environmental impact assessment in avoiding NIMBY,"With the development of urbanization, a number of public service facilities are needed to meet the demand of urban residents’ livelihood. However, some of these facilities, such as kitchen waste treatment station and waste incineration power plant, can cause negative effects on the surrounding environment, and harm the health of the residents. Therefore, resistance and conflicts are generated during the establishment of these public facilities between the surrounding residents and local authorities. Based on several NIMBY cases (Xi’erqi kitchen waste treatment station, Taiyuan waste incineration power plant and the Keystone XL pipeline) this paper focus on the effects and relevant issues of environmental impact assessment (EIA) in avoiding “Not in my back yard” (NIMBY). Through analyzing the causes, process of environmental NIMBY conflicts and the measures taken by the local government, we found that EIA can promote the freedom of the project related information and public participation. By this way, local authority can safe guard the legal rights of citizens, maintain the justness and promote higher scientific level of planning during the construction of polluting NIMBY facilities. However, the EIA system in China is not yet mature, there still exist several issues in the practice: the low level of public participation, the low citizen confidence in government, the weak system and standards, and the technical imperfections. The drawbacks above that EIA can offer against NIMBY have attenuated greatly. In this paper, we put forward some suggestions to perfecting EIA system in avoiding NIMBY: increase government supervision over the work of information disclosure, improve the effectiveness of public participation, perfect the laws and institutions system, advance the research of the relevant technologies, and establish the demonstrating project. © Foundation Environmental Protection & Research-FEPR.", Environmental impact assessment (eia); Environmental law; Kitchen waste; Nimby; Public participation,1.0

However, cement plants contribute to environmental pollutions. Therefore, understanding the effect of activities in these potentially polluting centres will greatly help determine future strategies. For the control and prevention of pollution, it is necessary to use a model for the quantitative assessment of environmental impacts. In this study, the Folchi method has been using to recognize and identify environmental pollution by cement plants and effective solutions to decrease the negative impacts of environmental pollution by Shahrood cement plant. According to the results, the contamination generated by the plant, especially for environmental components such as air quality, area landscape, soil of the area, ecology, and area usage are more significant than other environmental components. The EIA results are then obtained and used to assess the sustainability of the complex using Phillips mathematical model.

318,"Analyzing the effectiveness of environmental impact assessment in Paraná, Brazil and California, United States with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis and the analytical hierarchy process","Environmental impact assessment (EIA) has become one of the most widespread environmental management instruments. Despite this, EIA is routinely criticized for being ineffective at impacting decision-making. This study compared the EIA systems of Paraná, Brazil and California, United States using the effectiveness dimensions from the EIA literature. This study formats the cases into contextual conditions using the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify the necessary or sufficient conditions that cause effective outcomes. These effectiveness outcomes are then ranked by EIA stakeholders via the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to identify stakeholder priorities and to improve stakeholder management. The results show that in Paraná stakeholders identified normative effectiveness as the most important dimension, while stakeholders in California identified this dimension as the second-most important following substantive effectiveness. Public participation was found to be a necessary condition for both substantive and normative effectiveness to occur. Early project definition was found to be sufficient for substantive effectiveness and necessary for normative effectiveness, for which stakeholder coordination was a sufficient condition. This suggests that in order for EIA to influence decision-making and foster sustainable development, greater care needs to be taken to actively engage stakeholders in public participation, with clear roles and project design communicated early on, and a clear role for regulatory authority to promote stakeholder coordination for acceptable outcomes. These findings suggest that some effectiveness dimensions are caused by similar conditions, which could help focus stakeholder management efforts and point to new avenues for future EIA effectiveness research. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.", AHP; EIA system; Environmental impact assessment; fsQCA; Stakeholder management,1.0

320,The evolution of China's environmental impact assessment system: Retrospect and prospect from the perspective of effectiveness evaluation,"It has been nearly 20 years since the Law of the People's Republic of China on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) formally came into effect in 2003. The development of China's EIA system has gone through the stages of exploration, practice and reform. The evaluation objects have expanded from construction projects to planning, and then to policies, forming an EIA system with Chinese characteristics. This paper first draws on the experience of international EIA effectiveness evaluation and puts forward a checklist combined with China's practice. Based on this checklist, the development of China's EIA system is systematically reviewed and analyzed from the perspective of effectiveness evaluation. Finally, this paper proposes keys and priorities for the future effectiveness improvement of China's EIA system, and puts forward policy recommendations of realistic value for EIA to help China achieve high-standard protection and high-quality development. It is found that, as an important means of environmental management, the laws and regulations system, and administration system of China's EIA system play an important role. However, there are still some imperfections. The connotation of Strategic Environmental Assessment in China still needs to be further enriched, and support system such as public participation need to be strengthened. © 2023", Effectiveness; EIA law; Environmental impact assessment (EIA); Planning EIA,1.0
321,Environmental impact assessment and hydraulic modelling of different flood protection measures,"The most appropriate method to protect settlements and economically important sites from flood hazard, is the implementation of flood protection measures in stream catchments and protected localities, which contribute to reduce the peak flow and distribution of the flood wave over a longer period of time. If such measures are not realistic or ineffective, it is necessary to focus on flood protection directly on the area of the protected side or its vicinity. Where the lag time between the flood threat detection and actual flood onset is short, one possible measure is to increase the capacity of the watercourse, very often in combination with other flood mitigation measures in the protected area. The engineering approach to flood protection is the subject of many scientific research studies. Permission for flood protection structures depends on their environmental impact assessment (EIA), according to Law no. 24/2002 Coll. on Environmental Impact Assessment in the Slovak Republic, annex no. 8 (list of activities subject to EIA). Based on the EIA, it is possible to select the best alternative of flood protection, i.e., the alternative with the lowest risk impact on the environment. This paper aims to analyse the flood protection measures along the Lukavica stream (central Slovakia), applying hydraulic models. The best alternative with the lowest impact on the environment, assessed using the risk analysis method, consists of detention reservoir construction. An effective combination of environmental impact assessment and hydraulic modelling contribute to the selection of an effective flood protection measure in the territory. © 2021 by the authors.", Detention reservoir design; Digital terrain model; Environmental impact assessment; Field measurements; Flood protection; Numerical modelling,1.0
322,Adaptation of EVIAVE methodology for monitoring and follow-up when evaluating the environmental impact of landfills,"Treatment and final disposal of Municipal Solid Waste can have a significant role in the generation of negative environmental impacts. As a prevention strategy, such activities are subjected to the process of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Still, the follow-up of EnvironmentalManagement Plans or mitigation measures is limited, for one due to a lack of methodological approaches. In searching for possibilities, the University of Granada (Spain) developed a diagnostic methodology named EVIAVE, which allows one to quantify, by means of indexes, the environmental impact of landfills in view of their location and the conditions of exploitation. EVIAVE is applicablewithin the legal framework of the European Union and can be adapted to the environmental and legal conditions of other countries. This study entails its adaptation in Colombia, for the follow-up and control of the EIA process for landfills. Modifications involved inclusion of the environmental elements flora and fauna, and the evaluation of the environmental descriptors in agreement with the concept of vulnerability. The application of the modified EVIAVE in Colombian landfills allowed us to identify the elements affected by the operating conditions and maintenance. It may be concluded that this methodology is viable and effective for the follow-up and environmental control of EIA processes for landfills, and to analyze the associated risks, as it takes into account related environmental threats and vulnerabilities. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.", Environmental Impact Assessment; EVIAVE methodology; Follow-up; Waste management,1.0
323,A model for estimating pollution emissions for individual economic activities,"To be effective, environmental policies must be informed by reliable assessments of the impact of economic activities. In turn, such impact assessments require comprehensive information on the pollution profiles of particular activities. In most countries and for many activities, such an information base does not exist. This article contributes to the environmental impact assessment process by introducing a method for filling part of the information gap with respect to industrial activities. It presents a pollution-estimation model that draws from published sources of information and allows analysts to obtain order-of-magnitude estimates of the pollution generated by an industrial activity. As an illustration, the model is applied to estimate the air emissions of a petroleum refinery under two different operating scenarios. Thus, it provides its potential users - policy-makers operating in a context of information scarcity - with a means to review the operation and pollution-generation characteristics of any industry in a comprehensive and rigorous manner.; To be effective, environmental policies mast be informed by reliable assessments of the impact of economic activities.

324,Environmental impact assessment in Uzbekistan,"The environmental impact assessment (EIA) system in Uzbekistan was inherited from the USSR and is centred on state environmental review, a procedure for reviewing the impacts of proposed activities by environmental authorities. This is proving to be a less effective tool of environmental protection in the new political and economic conditions. Since the collapse of the USSR, the Uzbekistani EIA system has undergone gradual reform but the national EIA system remains almost identical to the ‘socialist’ system. At the same time, some elements are similar to those of EIA systems used in developed countries. The shortcomings of the system include unclear screening provisions and lack of public participation.

325,Environmental Impact Assessments for deep-sea mining: Can we improve their future effectiveness?,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is an important process for evaluating the effects of development, and to assist decisions to effectively manage potential deep-sea mining (DSM). However, although EIA is a widely used and accepted approach, there has been considerable debate over its effectiveness. In this paper, we summarise some of the key problems raised by previous EIA reviews, as well as examining several EIAs carried out in recent years for DSM, and highlight issues identified by management agencies. Scientific shortcomings are discussed, and recommendations provided on ways to improve performance. These include inadequate baseline data, insufficient detail of the mining operation, insufficient synthesis of data and the ecosystem approach, poor assessment and consideration of uncertainty, inadequate assessment of indirect impacts, inadequate treatment of cumulative impacts, insufficient risk assessment, and consideration of linkages between EIA and other management plans. The focus of the paper is on scientific limitations, but we also consider some aspects of their application to elements of process and policy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd", Deep sea; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental management; Impacts; Seabed mining,1.0
326,Life cycle assessment of bridges using bayesian networks and fuzzy mathematics,"At present, reducing the impact of the construction industry on the environment is the key to achieving sustainable development. Countries all over the world are using software systems for bridge environmental impact assessment. However, due to the complexity and discreteness of environmental factors in the construction industry, they are difficult to update and determine quickly, and there is a phenomenon of data missing in the database. Most of the lost data are optimized by Monte Carlo simulation, which greatly reduces the reliability and accuracy of the research results. This paper uses Bayesian advanced fuzzy mathematics theory to solve this problem. In the research, a Bayesian fuzzy mathematics evaluation and a multi-level sensitivity priority discrimination model are established, and the weights and membership degrees of influencing factors were defined to achieve comprehensive coverage of influencing factors. With the support of theoretical modelling, software analysis and fuzzy mathematics theory are used to comprehensively evaluate all the influencing factors of the five influencing stages in the entire life cycle of the bridge structure. The results show that the material manufacturing, maintenance, and operation of the bridge still produce environmental pollution; the main source of the emissions exceeds 53% of the total emissions. The effective impact factor reaches 3.01. At the end of the article, a big data sensitivity model was established. Through big data innovation and optimization analysis, traffic pollution emissions were reduced by 330 tonnes. Modeling of the comprehensive research model; application; clearly confirms the effectiveness and practicality of the Bayesian network fuzzy number comprehensive evaluation model in dealing with uncertain factors in the evaluation of the sustainable development of the construction industry. The research results have made important contributions to the realization of the sustainable development goals of the construction industry. © 2021 by the authors.

327,A modified d numbers methodology for environmental impact assessment,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is usually evaluated by many factors influenced by various kinds of uncertainty or fuzziness. As a result, the key issues of EIA problem are to represent and deal with the uncertain or fuzzy information. D numbers theory, as the extension of Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence, is a desirable tool that can express uncertainty and fuzziness, both complete and incomplete, quantitative or qualitative. However, some shortcomings do exist in D numbers combination process, the commutative property is not well considered when multiple D numbers are combined. Though some attempts have made to solve this problem, the previous method is not appropriate and convenience as more information about the given evaluations represented by D numbers are needed. In this paper, a data-driven D numbers combination rule is proposed, commutative property is well considered in the proposed method. In the combination process, there does not require any new information except the original D numbers. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. © 2017 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.", D numbers theory; Decision making; EIA; Fuzziness; Incompleteness; Uncertainty,1.0

This article explores the role of the regulating agencies within the coal mining sector in India to determine the extent to which the agencies have been successful in ensuring environmental protection through EIA follow-up. In doing so, the work adopts a qualitative approach. Three case studies in three different states in India are examined. These reveal the weaknesses of the regulating agencies in India and the skewed balance of power in favour of the developers. This causes development to completely overshadow environmental concerns. The study conclusions offer suggestions based on how the regulating agencies need to accommodate effective EIA follow-up in the varying contexts of the different states.", ,1.0
330,Impacts assessment and trade-offs of fuel cell-based auxiliary power units Part I: System performance and cost modeling,"Auxiliary power units (APUs) are devices that can provide all or part of the non-propulsion power of a vehicle. They do not replace the main internal combustion engine, but they complement it offering low consumption, high comfort and low emissions during the idling periods of the vehicle. This work presents an integrated framework to evaluate the trade-offs between cost effectiveness, efficiency and health and environmental impacts of fuel cell power systems considering various stages of the life cycle of the device. The integrated framework has six main components, namely system level modeling, cost modeling, environmental impact assessment, health impact assessment, life cycle assessment and multi-objective optimization. In part I of these two papers, concerning the integrated framework, the first two components are described and applied to a solid oxide fuel cell-based auxiliary power unit.

The study demonstrates the potential of agent-based systems to adapt a weighting system to dynamic conditions, and suggests integrating an agent-based model to handle uncertainties of weighting in environmental impact assessment. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and multi-agent systems (MAS) are utilized to address data limitations and simulate diverse scenarios. We confirm the potential of agent-based systems to analyse the effective management of uncertainties and customization of weighting systems in environmental impact assessments to improve decision making. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of continuous adaptation and recalibration to ensure the system remains relevant in dynamic environments. The results confirm that MAS is a powerful tool for managing uncertainty, customizing weighting systems and improving decision making in environmental assessments. Moreover, the study acknowledges challenges and sets the groundwork for future research.  © 2024 The Authors.", complex-social systems; dynamic life cycle assessment; environmental impact assessment; generative adversarial networks; multi-agent systems,0.0
332,Ecological impact assessment; Conceptual approach for better outcomes,"This study aims at evaluating the completeness of the content of the ecological part in Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) on content review basis. The requirements of the ecological content as stated in the of five sets of Thai's EIA guidelines, namely the specific guidelines for power plants, industrial projects, dams and harbors and the general guideline are used as the basis for this research. The main findings are that the requirements of the content of the ecological part in the guidelines differ from one guideline to another and the most different one is the specific guideline for dam projects. Generally, ecosystem, habitat and species population are presented. The guideline specifies the requirements for data presentation more clearly than those for ecological impact assessment. In addition, thirty EISs of power plant projects are systematically reviewed and it is found that there are a number of improper practices of ecological impact assessment process including insufficient baseline study, inconsistent impact interpretation, and ignorance of ecological point of view in setting up mitigation measures and monitoring programs. Ecological content in EIA guidelines and EISs can be shown in a logical sequence of events in order to form an effective system of ecological impact assessment.", Content analysis; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental impact statements; Guidelines; Power plant projects; Thailand,1.0
333,Landscape Degradation Modelling: An Environmental Impact Assessment for Rural Landscape Prioritisation,"Landscape Degradation Assessment (LDA) of rural areas can play a crucial role in landscape planning. Japan lacks quantitative and cumulative Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) methodologies, especially in the area of LDA. Although a decision support system is in place for very large projects (Class-1) in Japan, EIAs for much smaller projects are non-existent, which often results in ambiguity with regard to environmental problems. To improve the transparency of the decision-making process for rural landscape planning, increase the scale of the assessment of project size to a more strategic local level, and enhance effective communication with decision-makers, a new EIA procedure is proposed with the development of a Landscape Degradation Model (LDM) for rural areas in Japan. The procedure is based on the equation, LD =Σ kI/V, where LD represents the degradation coefficient of the landscape compartments, Σ kI represents the cumulative impact of human activities, and V quantifies the vulnerability of a habitat. The value of LD provides a means for supporting decisions aimed at the quantitative prioritisation of working units and developing respective conservation plans. This methodology is a holistic approach to rural landscape reclamation decision support systems where these LDM findings are geared toward sustainability appraisal and where integrated assessment of the economics of a proposal is recommended. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.", EIA; Haizuka Dam; Japan; landscape compartments; Landscape Degradation Model; rural landscape,1.0
334,The role of gear technologists in supporting an ecosystem approach to fisheries,"Central to an ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) is reconciling the short-term need for catches with the long-term need for sustainability of target species and other ecosystem components. We assess the role of gear technology in supporting the objectives and implementation of EAF and identify the circumstances in which investment in the environmental performance of fishing gear provides the greatest benefits. The greatest benefits are usually achieved when gear technologists embed the new technology in the management system and when there are clear incentives to use it. We propose a framework for comparing combinations of management measures that might support EAF, based on knowledge of the environmental impacts of different gears in different areas and management systems. This framework helps us assess when fishing effects ""matter"" and when gear technologists should contribute to mitigating unwanted effects. Incentives and effective enforcement will be key to introducing gears with lower environmental impact. We expect that future emphasis on marine spatial planning, the use of environmental impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment for fisheries, more equitable treatment of fisheries and other marine sectors, and rising oil prices will lead to greater pressure on gear technologists to support EAF.

335,A Conceptual Model for Identifying and Ranking Environmental Risks in Industrial Parks (A Case Study of Hashtgerd Industrial Estate),"Introduction: The main purpose of this study was to identify and evaluate environmental problems and their ranking and to determine the conceptual model of environmental impact assessment (EIA) in industrial parks. Accordingly. Material and Methods: In this study, environmental infrastructure issues were classified into five sections. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique was also employed to establish the relationships between the criteria. Moreover, the analytic network process (ANP) was utilized to determine their weight. Results: Examining the internal relationships between the variables correspondingly revealed that cultural and economic criteria were the most influential. On the other hand, the biological criterion was very effective. The ANP results also showed that the “low share of environmental investment” as an indicator was an economic criterion with a normal weight of 0.80, which was of utmost importance among the other defined cases. Conclusion: It was concluded that the definition of conceptual models in EIA processes can make it possible to examine and analyze the criteria and indicators affecting evaluation processes. © 2021, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

336,Environmental impact assessment of power development project: Lessons from Thailand experiences,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an important part of environmental and public health regulations. Increasing demand of electric consumption in Thailand is a major challenge for authorities trying to ensure satisfactory supply. However, the adverse impacts of development projects are powerful public concerns. Preparations of adequate EIA reports contribute to enhancing overall effectiveness of the EIA process. A sample of 3 EIA reports relating to power development projects was examined, to identify problems and to investigate typical strong and weak points of environmental impact statements, for effective implementation of EIA in Thailand. The competent authority has a well formulated environmental legislation and EIA guidelines and uses a listing method as a key quality control instrument for accuracy and veracity of the reports. Comprehensive descriptions of the major issues and the adverse impacts were defined based on the nature of the construction and operation phases, with adequate information to inform on existing attributes and situations appearing in all critiqued samples. The most important lessons are that there was an absence or weakness in: (i) information on baseline conditions and site-specific information (ii) public participation and (iii) communication involvement of all stakeholders. Increased enforcement could be based on strong, well-written law. The establishment of an independent review committee's regulation, widespread public participation in every step of the EIA process and formulation of a code of conduct for the consultants, are strongly recommended.", ASEAN nations; Community trust; EIA guidelines; EIA report evaluation; Energy development policy; Public participation,1.0

During this time, the EIA system has evolved to reflect both political and bureaucracy changes. However, the current implementation and effectiveness of the EIA process have not yet to be fully understood. This study aims to review the current implementation of EIA, to assess the effectiveness of EIA process procedurally, and to provide recommendations. In order to examine the effectiveness of EIA, we evaluate and compare the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) of nickel smelters against criteria. The results indicate that the screening and scoping process encountered problems in terms of scientific database availability, cost, and time of the study. Public participation was not effective due to the constraints of information channeling and weaknesses of the discussion process. We found insufficient synchronization between the evaluation and monitoring processes. EIA reporting indicated redundancy, inconsistency, and ambiguity. We recommend the political reinforcement of the will of the government to establish sustainable policy in terms of budgeting, human resources, and procedure of decision-making process in EIA. © 2019, © 2019 IAIA.", Content analysis; EIR; evaluation and monitoring; public participation; reporting; screening and scoping,1.0
338,Inter-nesting distribution of flatback turtles Natator depressus and industrial development in Natator Australia,"Offshore interactions of inter-nesting flatback turtles Natator depressus with resource industry activities are potentially frequent, yet the associated impact is largely unquantified. Consequently, there is a need to understand the degree of interaction and to provide data that can assist with effective conservation and management. We used satellite tracking to highlight the potential interaction of inter-nesting flatback turtles (n = 56) from 4 rookeries in Western Australia with regional resource industry activities. Flatback turtles demonstrated varying inter-nesting movements, with displacement distances ranging from 3.4 to 62.1 km. Some turtles at all 4 rookeries remained <10 km from the nesting beach. Core home range areas for inter-nesting flatback turtles ranged from 1.4 to 601.1 km2. The proportion of core home range areas for Thevenard and Barrow Island turtles that overlapped offshore petroleum title areas was 85.7 and 88.6%, respectively. The proportion of median daily positions that overlapped petroleum title areas was also high, 80.8% (Thevenard) and 87.3% (Barrow). There was no overlap of home range areas and median daily positions with petroleum title areas for Mundabullangana and Port Hedland turtles, although some inter-nesting movements of Port Hedland turtles were in close proximity to a proposed port expansion. The wide-ranging inter-nesting movement patterns highlight a need for the Australian Government and industry to expand the scope of Environmental Impact Assessments, ensuring adequate protection is provided to inter-nesting flatback turtles. The similar nearshore inter-nesting movement pattern recorded by some flatback turtles at each rookery provides an opportunity to establish boundaries for small-scale spatial and temporal protection measures. © The authors 2014.", Australia; EIA; Environmental impact assessment; Flatback; Industry; Inter-nesting; Satellite tracking,0.0
339,Communication problems and alternatives in the process of collecting resident opinions for environmental impact assessment through text mining: A case study of the Dangjin landfill in Korea,"Do even projects that have already collected residents' opinions as a part of their environmental impact assessment (EIA) processes face opposition from residents later? Previous studies have noted that the public participation process of EIA is regarded as a mere formality, and that its effectiveness in reflecting residents' opinions remains unclear. Nevertheless, research on the public participation process is lacking. It should be supplemented with sufficient communication and address the potential of achieving this through policy application. This study aimed to identify the problems with, and alternatives to, the current process of collecting resident opinions during EIA by analyzing the case of the Dangjin landfill project in Korea, which was opposed by residents despite their having participated in the assessment. According to the analysis results, the contents of the conversations were divided into two categories: establishment of reduction measures and environmental impact surveys. Most resident opinions were related to the establishment of reduction measures (71.70%), followed by those related to the local (65.20%), metropolitan (63.32%), and central governments (62.96%). However, the change between the preliminary small-scale review (52.29%) and third-round decision review (58.06%) was not significant. In terms of high-frequency words, the first preliminary review and third-round decision by the Ministry of Environment were similar, but both greatly differed from the second-round resident opinions. These results indicate that although residents had many questions regarding measures for reducing environmental pollution, the preliminary small-scale review and third-round decision phases only involved discussions on conducting environmental impact surveys. The contents of the conversations pertained to the residents requesting long-term, wide-ranging, and realistic health-related alternatives; however, the responses were highly technical, and the discussions only concerned performing procedural environmental impact surveys. Additionally, the use of different content and language perspectives hindered communication. It was also difficult to confirm whether the residents' opinions were reflected. These results suggest the need for the use of more relatable and comprehensible language by experts during the public participation process, and that a mutually understandable language perspective through multilateral participation should be the foundation for policy application. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.", Acceptance; Dangjin; Public opinion; Semantic network; Text mining,1.0
340,Fishers’ local ecological knowledge indicate migration patterns of tropical freshwater fish in an Amazonian river,"The local ecological knowledge (LEK) of fishers may help to fill the knowledge gaps about migration of tropical fish. We investigated fishers’ LEK on migratory patterns of seven fish species along 550 km of the Tapajos River, in the Brazilian Amazon. We interviewed 270 fishers individually in four stretches of this river. The interviewed fishers indicated that three fish species do not migrate over long distances, while four fish species perform migrations, usually longitudinal migration from downstream to upstream reaches. Fishers also mentioned an increase in size of a large catfish species in the upstream stretches of the studied river, indicating the potential occurrence of spawning adults there. These results from fishers’ knowledge indicated that planned dams in the upstream reaches of the Tapajos River will threaten migratory fishes, small-scale fisheries and food security. Fishers’ LEK on fish migration contributed to raise testable biological hypotheses about fish spawning and feeding grounds, as well as the occurrence of distinct populations along the river. The analysis of the LEK of many fishers at several sites over a broad range is a cost-effective source of information on fish migration, supporting environmental impact assessment, fisheries management, and conservation in this and other tropical rivers. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.", Dams; Environmental impacts; Ethnobiology; Fish conservation; Fish reproduction; Small-scale fisheries,1.0
341,“Ripe for decision”: Tiering in environmental assessment,"Tiering of information and decisions from more strategic plans to more specific projects (and sometimes the other way) can streamline plan-making and assessments, and improve decisions at each planning tier. In particular, it can lead to more consistent and comprehensive impact mitigation at the lower tiers. In practice, however, tiering of assessments is carried out only sporadically. This paper reviews the international literature and case studies on Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) tiering, and presents the findings of interviews with 14 SEA/EIA experts. It concludes that a conscious and explicit transfer of information from the SEA level, and an explicit receipt of this information at the EIA level are necessary prerequisites for effective tiering. SEAs must be carried out with local actions in mind, in order for mitigation measures to support environmental protection on the ground. Lower-tier decision-makers must also be willing to be bound by decisions by the higher-tier SEA, focusing on implementation of these decisions. © 2020", Decision tiers; Environmental impact assessment; Information transfer; Strategic environmental assessment,1.0
342,Environmental impacts cost assessment model of residential building using an artificial neural network,"Purpose: Buildings are major contributors to greenhouse gases (GHG) along the various stages of the building life cycle. A range of tools have been utilised for estimating building energy use and environmental impacts; these are time-consuming and require massive data that are not necessarily available during early design stages. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an Environmental Impacts Cost Assessment Model (EICAM) that quantifies both energy and environmental costs for residential buildings. Design/methodology/approach: An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was employed to develop the EICAM. The model consists of six input parameters, including wall type, roof type, glazing type, window to wall ratio (WWR), shading device and building orientation. In addition, the model calculates four measures: annual energy cost, operational carbon over 20 years, envelope embodied carbon and total carbon per square metre. The ANN architecture is 6:13:4:4, where the conjugate gradient algorithm was applied to train the model and minimise the mean squared error (MSE). Furthermore, regression analysis for the ANN prediction for each output was performed. Findings: The MSE was minimised to 0.016 while training the model. Also, the correlation between each ANN output and the actual output was very strong, with an R2 value for each output of almost 0.998. Moreover, validation was conducted for each output, with the error percentages calculated at 0.26%, 0.25%, 0.03% and 0.27% for the annual energy cost, operational carbon, envelope materials embodied carbon and total carbon per square metre, respectively. Accordingly, the EICAM contributes to enhancing design decision-making concerning energy consumption and carbon emissions in the early design stages. Research limitations/implications: This study provides theoretical implications to the domain of building environmental impact assessment through illustrating a systematic approach for developing an energy-based prediction model that generates four environmental-oriented outputs, namely energy cost, operational energy carbon, envelope embodied carbon, and total carbon. The model developed has practical implications for the architectural/engineering (A/E) industries by providing a useful tool to easily predict environmental impact costs during the early design phase. This would enable designers in Saudi Arabia to make effective design decisions that would increase sustainability in the building life cycle. Originality/value: By providing a holistic predictive model entitled EICAM, this study endeavours to bridge the gap between energy costs and environmental impacts in a predictive model for Saudi residential units. The novelty of this model is that it is an alternative tool that quantifies both energy cost, as well as building’s environmental impact, in one model by using a machine learning approach. Besides, EICAM predicts its outcomes more quickly than conventional tools such as DesignBuilder and is reliable for predicting accurate environmental impact costs during early design stages. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.", Artificial neural networks; Building envelope; Embodied carbon; Energy cost; Operational carbon,0.0
343,Environmental flows and life cycle assessment of associated petroleum gas utilization via combined heat and power plants and heat boilers at oil fields,"Flaring of associated petroleum gas is a major resource waste and causes considerable emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants. New environmental regulations are forcing oil industry to implement innovative and sustainable technologies in order to compete in growing energy market. A modern trend of introducing energy-effective cogeneration systems to the oil fields by replacing flaring and existing heat generation technologies powered by associated petroleum gas is discussed through material flow analysis and environmental impact assessment. The environmental assessment is based on the consequential life cycle assessment method and mainly primary data compiled directly from measurements on Serbian oil-fields or company-supplied information. The obtained results confirm that the utilization of associated petroleum gas via combined heat and power plants and heat boilers can provide a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion by displacing marginal production of heat and electricity. At the base case scenario, which assumes a 100% heat realization rate, the global warming potential of the combined heat and power plant and heat boiler scenarios were estimated at -4.94 and -0.54 kg CO2eq Sm-3, whereas the cumulative fossil energy requirements of these scenarios were -48.7 and -2.1 MJ Sm-3, respectively. This is a significant reduction compared to the global warming potential (2.25 kg CO2eq Sm-3) and cumulative fossil energy requirements (35.36 MJ Sm-3) of flaring. Nevertheless, sensitivity analyses have shown that life cycle assessment results are sensitive to heat utilization rate and the choice of marginal technology. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

344,Benchmarking performance: Environmental impact statements in Egypt,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) was formally introduced in Egypt in 1994. This short paper evaluates ""how well"" the EIA process is working in practice in Egypt, by reviewing the quality of 45 environmental impact statements (EISs) produced between 2000 and 2007 for a variety of project types. The Lee and Colley review package was used to assess the quality of the selected EISs. About 69% of the EISs sampled were found to be of a satisfactory quality. An assessment of the performance of different elements of the EIA process indicates that descriptive tasks tend to be performed better than scientific tasks.

345,The Predicament and Outlet of Environmental Impact Assessment Mechanism from the Perspective of Risk Society: Taking Japan’s Accident-Type Nuclear Sewage Disposal as a Cut-In,"As an important yardstick of social modernization, nuclear technology not only promotes the in-depth development of the national economy but also hangs a sword of Damocles in the field of the risk society. Against the background of the unrest of the nuclear leakage disaster at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, the Japanese government has announced its unilateral decision to discharge nuclear sewage into the sea, undoubtedly putting at least the Pacific Rim countries at huge potential risks. In order to maximize risk reduction and focus on preventive construction in advance, Japan’s measures to discharge accident nuclear sewage into the sea have a legitimate basis for the application of an environmental impact assessment system. At the same time, in the process of operation, there are numerous risk dilemmas, such as lack of safety treatment standards, long follow-up disposal cycle and negative domestic supervision system, which need to be broken through one by one. The effective application of the environmental impact assessment system in the Japanese nuclear accident not only helps to reduce the environmental crisis caused by accidental nuclear effluent discharge to the sea but also has a positive and far-reaching international demonstration significance, which helps to better build a foundation of international trust and preventive guarantee system in advance for the possible accidental nuclear effluent treatment in the future. © 2023 by the authors.", accident-type nuclear sewage; environmental impact assessment system; risk society; the no-harm principle,1.0
346,Environmental impacts and cost-effectiveness of Thailand's centralized municipal wastewater treatment plants with different nutrient removal processes,"This research investigates the organic and nutrient removal efficiency of eight centralized municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Thailand's capital Bangkok, under five treatment schemes. The environmental impacts were assessed using life cycle assessment, and the cost-effectiveness was determined by life cycle cost assessment. The five treatment schemes were contact stabilization (scheme A/base case), activated-sludge with nutrient removal (scheme B), cyclic activated-sludge (scheme C), two-stage activated-sludge (scheme D), and vertical loop reactor activated-sludge (scheme E). The results showed that scheme A achieved the highest organic removal efficiency (93.01% on average), with all other treatment schemes achieving more than 83% removal efficiency. Scheme E achieved the highest total phosphorus and total nitrogen removal efficiencies (69.12% and 59.74% on average), and scheme C was effective in removing total Kjeldahl nitrogen and ammonia (82.84% and 89.12% on average). The environmental impact assessment indicated that electricity use was the major contributor of almost all environmental impact categories except aquatic eutrophication. Scheme E had the lowest environmental impacts in almost all categories except aquatic eutrophication. Total costs (including operation, maintenance, and environmental costs) of WWTPs with nutrient removal were lower than without nutrient removal. Scheme E had the lowest total cost (2.754 THB2017 per m3) and lowest compounds removal costs, in addition to highest nutrient removal efficiency. Scheme E is the most cost-effective scheme with lowest environmental impacts (i.e., the most eco-efficiency scheme). © 2020", Efficiency; Environmental costs; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost assessment; Operation and maintenance costs,0.0
347,To fly or not to fly? Comparing vantage point and uncrewed aerial vehicle surveys for assessments of seabird abundance and fine-scale distribution,"Marine renewable energy developments (e.g. offshore wind, wave, and tidal) are an increasing feature within the marine environment. It is therefore important to understand the potential impacts of such developments on seabirds that use these environments. Land-based vantage point (VP) surveys are widely used to collect data for environmental impact assessments (EIAs) within tidal stream energy sites. However, tidal stream environments are highly dynamic and present challenges when conducting VP surveys, for example there can be varying detectability of seabirds due to near-surface turbulence. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) to quantify animal abundance and distribution. Yet, to be effective for its use in EIAs, this approach needs to be assessed alongside standardised methods. This study provides the first comparison of at-sea abundance and distribution of surface-foraging seabirds in flight within a tidal stream environment using concurrent VP surveys and UAV transects. Applying a combination of GLMMs and GAMs, our results show that the two survey types produced similar counts of surface-foraging seabirds (tern species) in flight and reveal the influence of covariates affecting counts, including tidal state, sea state, and observer ID. Further, we estimated the overlap (Bhattacharyya's affinity) between tern utilization distributions as a function of tidal state to compare the fine-scale distributions derived from each survey type. The distribution of terns detected, particularly by UAV transects indicated that the highest tern density occurred within the near-shore shallows during the ebb tide and extended into the main channel during the flood tide. Specifically, the UAV transects captured the association of terns with a visible shear line extending into the main channel. Therefore, EIAs may benefit from the use of UAV transect surveys alongside VP surveys to identify fine-scale distributions of seabirds more accurately. Despite these potential benefits, the application of UAVs for use in EIAs may be limited by the species resolution achievable using UAV imagery as well as the impacts of adverse weather conditions and low sun angles (glare). Ultimately, the selection of survey techniques will depend on the specific aims of the EIA, the target species, and species behaviour. © 2022 The Author(s)", Drone; EIA; Land-based surveys; Marine renewable energy; Ornithology; Survey method,1.0
348,Regional restrictions on environmental impact assessment approval in China: The legitimacy of environmental authoritarianism,"The poor enforcement and effectiveness of environmental impact assessment (EIA) on construction and investment projects in China has long been blamed for not preventing environmental pollution and degradation. At the same time, freezing EIA approval of all new projects in an administrative region, introduced in 2006 as a punishment for failing to meet regional environmental quality targets, has been regarded as an innovative administrative instrument used by higher level environmental authorities on local governments. But it also raised controversies. Applying an environmental authoritarianism perspective, this study analyzed the legitimacy and environmental effectiveness of freezing EIA approval procedures by reviewing all 25 national cases and 12 provincial cases of so-called EIA Restrictions Targeting Regions between 1 December 2006 and 31 December 2013. The results show that such an environmental authoritarian measure is to some extent environmentally effective but lacks legality and transparency towards and participation of third parties, and hence falls short in legitimacy. Legal foundations and wider third party participation are essential for the long term effectiveness of this policy and its transfer to other countries. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

349,Properties of sustainable cement mortars containing high volume of raw diatomite,"This paper presents the results of a study on properties of cement mortars containing high volume of raw diatomite powder as replacement of cement. The use of high volume of pozzolanic powders decreases the demand for cement in the construction industry and thus reduces the cost of concrete production and lessens the environmental pollution caused by the CO2 emission from the cement factories. The aim of this study is to investigate key properties of environmental-friendly cement mortars using raw diatomite powder as replacement of cement in different contents. In this study, cement mortars containing four different contents of raw diatomite powder as replacement of cement (0, 15, 30 and 40 by weight of total cementitious material) are examined. The flowability of cement mortars was observed through flow table test. The compressive strength and direct tensile strength were measured at 3, 7, 28 and 91 days as strength properties. Water absorption and pulse velocity tests were investigated for various cement mortar mixtures at 28 days as transport properties and durability indexes. An environmental impact assessment was also applied on all cement mortar mixes based on eco-balance method to quantify and evaluate the environmental impact of partially replacing cement by raw diatomite powder. Test results indicated that diatomite powder can be used as replacement of cement up to 40% without significant loss in compressive strength along with an improvement in tensile strength and transport properties of cement mortars, at the later aging times. The experimental results on strength and transport properties represent a very effective and successful use of high volume raw diatomite powder to produce an environmental-friendly and affordable cement-based material. Sustainability assessment shows a significant reduction in environmental impact of mortars containing high volume of raw diatomite powder. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.", Cement mortars; Environmental impact; Raw diatomite powder; Strength properties; Transport properties,0.0
350,The treatment of the social dimension in environmental impact assessment: A content analysis applied to the case of the Valencian autonomous region; [El tratamiento de la dimensión social en los estudios de impacto ambiental: Análisis de contenido aplicado al caso de la Comunidad Valenciana],"For many years there have been numerous calls for effective inclusion of social analysis in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Also, the current legislation in most developed countries addresses this issue by both recognizing citizen participation as a basic principle of the process and explicitly requiring an account of the consequences a project will have on the affected population. This paper examines how these demands are put into practice in EIA procedures in the Valencian Autonomous Region in Spain. We analysed the content of the Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) submitted to the Valencian regional administration, Spain, in 2014-2015. This analysis explores the chacarteris-tics of the social analysis in the EISs, and to what depth social factors are treated in their environment inventory and identification of social impact sections.

351,Environmental impact assessment of infrastructure projects: a governance perspective,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been promoted as an instrument for preventive environmental management in construction projects, but its performance in safeguarding the environment through influencing project decision-making is questioned. This paper probes the underlying reasons from a governance perspective as an important supplement to the regulatory and technical perspectives. A framework, with process integration, professional governance, and public engagement being its key components, is proposed to analyze the governance arrangements that enable or inhibit the effective functioning of EIA, based on which a comparative study of three infrastructure projects in China, the United States and Finland was conducted. The results reveal that, while the level of process integration and public engagement of EIA determines the degree to which EIA influences project decisions, it is the professional governance that controls the accountability of EIA. The paper has implications on institutionally where efforts should be directed to improve the performance of EIA. © 2015 University of Newcastle upon Tyne.", cross-national comparative studies; environmental impact assessment; project governance,1.0
352,Open-pit Mining Area Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images Based on DUSegNet,"Remote sensing is an important technical means for monitoring and protecting mineral resources. However, because of the complex surface environment, very few good results have been achieved in the study of automatic open-pit mining area segmentation. Inspired by SegNet, UNet and D-LinkNet, this paper proposes a novel deep convolutional neural network for pixel-level semantic segmentation of optical remote sensing images termed DUSegNet. In this network, the pyramid model and upsampling method of pooling indices, similar to SegNet, are employed in the encoder–decoder architecture. In addition, the convolutional skip connection architecture, similar to UNet, is adopted to connect shallow features to the decoder. Additionally, the serial-parallel model, similar to D-LinkNet; the intensifier constructed by dilated convolution; and the classifier constructed by softmax layers are applied in the process of encoding and decoding. In the practical application stage, we present an effective open-pit mining area segmentation method for entire remote sensing images, which has great significance for practical work, such as environmental impact assessment procedures and mine management. In the experimental stage, we compared the open-pit mining area segmentation effects of SegNet, UNet, DecovNet, and DUSegNet on the same dataset manually collected from GF-2 remote sensing images and verified the advantages of DUSegNet using graphic results and optimal evaluation metrics, such as AP (0.94) and F-score (0.67). © 2021, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.", Deep convolutional neural network; Open-pit mining area; Optical remote sensing image; Semantic segmentation,1.0
353,Implementing Landscape Fragmentation as an Indicator in the Swiss Monitoring System of Sustainable Development (Monet),"There is an increasing need and interest in including indicators of landscape fragmentation in monitoring systems of sustainable landscape management. Landscape fragmentation due to transportation infrastructure and urban development threatens human and environmental well-being by noise and pollution from traffic, reducing the size and viability of wildlife populations, facilitating the spread of invasive species, and impairing the scenic and recreational qualities of the landscape. This paper provides the rationale, method, and data for including landscape fragmentation in monitoring systems, using as an example the Swiss Monitoring System of Sustainable Development (Monet). We defined and compared four levels of fragmentation analysis, or fragmentation geometries (FGs), each based on different fragmenting elements, e.g., only anthropogenic, or combinations of anthropogenic and natural elements. As each FG has specific strengths and weaknesses, the most appropriate choice of FG depends on the context and objectives of a study. We present data on the current degree of landscape fragmentation for the five ecoregions and 26 cantons in Switzerland for all four FGs. Our results show that the degree of landscape fragmentation as quantified by the effective mesh size method is strongly supported by the postulates and indicator selection criteria of Monet, and we identify the most suitable FG focusing on the land area below 2100 m (e.g., excluding lakes) and allowing for an equitable comparison of fragmentation degrees among regions that differ in area covered by lakes and high mountains. For a more detailed analysis of landscape fragmentation in the context of environmental impact assessments and strategic environmental assessments, a combination of all four FGs may provide a more informative tool than any single FG. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

354,Ethiopia: History of the Implementation of Environmental Impact Assessment Proclamation No. 299/2002,"The government of Ethiopia introduced environmental impact assessment (EIA) by proclamation in 2002. The overall objective of this study is to critically and qualitatively assess the implementation of that proclamation, considering the level of public participation and the adequacy and effectiveness of legally established laws in the EIA process. This study revealed that the role of public participation in the entire EIA stages is weak. The study also identified that both the legal and institutional frameworks have remained inadequate to ensure full effectiveness of the EIA system. Moreover, this study describes the existence of weak coordination among or between federal, regional, zonal and other sectoral units. Hence, this study recommends that its effective implementation necessarily requires involvement of the public and the issuance of more specific subsidiary instruments.  © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

355,Hydrocarbon-Oxidizing Bacteria in the Digestive System of Fish as an Indicator of Coastal Pollution,"Abstract: Assessment of pollution of marine environment and biota with hydrocarbons is of particular importance, since oil products are among the priority pollutants of many seas. Development of new environmental toxicological biomarkers is one of the promising methods of integrated assessment of pollution effects. Here, the first investigation on the abundance of hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria in the digestive system of coastal fish (stickleback, dace, white bream, common bleak, perch, gudgeon, and roach) from the eastern Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea has been performed. The results reflect changes occurring in the environment and indicate contamination of water and sediments with oil and oil products. The relative abundance of hydrocarbon-oxidizing bacteria in the digestive tract of fish is an effective, sensitive, and low-cost indicator of environmental pollution that can be used in monitoring and environmental impact assessment of the aquatic ecosystems. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.", Baltic Sea; biodegradation; Gulf of Finland; microorganisms; oil; oil products; stickleback,0.0
356,Barriers to environmental impact assessment implementation for construction projects in Nigeria,"Purpose: Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is one of the best approaches to identifying, preventing, minimising, compensating for any unfavourable impacts on the environment and also encouraging sustainability. This paper aims to investigate the barriers to EIA implementation for construction projects in Nigeria. Design/methodology/approach: The study adopted a survey research technique. The snowball sampling approach was adopted to identify key stakeholders in EIA practice for the administration of questionnaire. A total of 187 questionnaires were administered and a response rate of 60% (113 questionnaires were adequately filled and returned) was achieved. Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilised in analysing elicited data. Findings: The results from data analysis showed that, “failure to influence the decision-making process/multiple conflicting decision-making”, “unstable regulatory regime”, “lack of available, accessible and fit-for purpose data”, “inadequate public knowledge of legal issues” and “poor provision of information” were the top most five barriers to EIA implementation for construction projects in Nigeria. Also, the results from the research show a statistically significant degree of agreement on the rankings by the groups of key stakeholders in EIA concerning the barriers to EIA implementation for construction projects. Originality/value: This paper contributed to more effective EIA studies by drawing attentions to barriers to EIA implementation for construction projects. An understanding of these barriers can help key stakeholders in the construction industry of developing countries such as Nigeria to facilitate development of methods required in reducing barriers to EIA implementation in the construction sector. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.", Barriers; Construction industry; Construction projects; Environmental impact assessment; Implementation; Nigeria,1.0
357,Environmental impact assessment (EIA) screening and scoping of extraterrestrial exploration and development projects,"Numerous space missions are planned by government agencies and private companies, with objectives including scientific research, prospecting for and mining resources, and establishing human settlements. These projects have potential to affect the extraterrestrial environment. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an important tool for assessing the potential impact of projects on Earth’s environment. However, the legal requirements to undertake EIA for extraterrestrial projects are limited and most EIAs that have been conducted have not considered impacts beyond Earth’s atmosphere. Technical barriers to extraterrestrial EIA also need to be overcome, including a lack of guidelines and methodologies. This paper addresses the latter issue by identifying the extraterrestrial impacts that may arise from space projects and relating them to the environmental topic areas in the European EIA Directive. An example is then provided of how EIA screening and scoping can be undertaken for the extraterrestrial elements of space projects, using six scenarios. Effective EIA screening and scoping is key to deciding whether EIA is required and if so which topic areas should be included. © 2018, IAIA.", EIA; Environmental impact assessment; Extraterrestrial environment; Outer space; Scoping; Screening,1.0
358,Impact assessment on soil erosion due to highway construction using GIS,"Infrastructure development is the basic need of any developing country and highway is one of the most important infrastructure. Road development affects the environment in big way. Highway construction involves huge land clearance and land use change, so causes impact on soil erosion of the area. In India, environmental impact assessment (EIA) was made a mandatory requirement to obtain environmental clearance for listed 29 categories of large scale developmental projects under the EIA notification (as amended 4 May 1994) (Government of India, MoEF). Assessment of soil erosion is a cost and time-consuming task. There are many models developed to predict soil erosion from an area, but Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is most widely used empirical equation for estimating annual soil erosion. Soil erosion depends upon-rainfall intensity, type of soil, land cover and land use, slope and slope length and soil conservation practice. All these parameters are having spatial distribution and hence satellite remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) can have a wide application in impact assessment on soil erosion. In this paper a case study on impact assessment of soil erosion due to a highway project has been presented. USLE has been used to predict the soil erosion and making erodibility map of the study area, using satellite remote sensing and GIS techniques and the impact on soil erosion due to change in land use caused by highway construction has been identified for the area directly affected by the construction of highway. In this study it is found that GIS based USLE model is suitable for assessing the impact on soil erosion due to highway construction and it is an effective tool to pursue the impacts to decision makers.", Environmental impact assessment (EIA); Geographic information system (GIS); Highway project; Soil erosion,1.0

However, the lack of consistency and coordination in implementing EIA, has reduced its effectiveness. Comparative studies of four EIA systems (including the Espoo convention) indicate their strengths and weaknesses in comparison with the Timor Gap process. Although there were clear procedures for EIA in Indonesia and Australia, incorporation of both systems into a transboundary EIA was not simple. Particular stages of the Timor Gap EIA system were inadequately implemented and the system needs to be improved.

360,Concepts and Views from International Relations and their Potential Contribution to Impact Assessment Thinking and Practice,"Analysts of environmental impact assessment and sustainability assessment tools recognise that ideally different types of knowledge and thinking need to be incorporated for such tools to be more effective in their sustainability objectives. Broadening thinking help to understanding complex issues these tools aspire to uncover. The sole use of positivist lenses is inadequate in seeking to better understand complexity. Assessment tools are usually formulated in a rational-technical or positivist manner. This can be problematic. The tools are driven by top-down technocratic motivations, which is not always ideal for an ever increasing complex society. Paradigms and theories influence our conceptualisation of phenomena and actions we take. This has been recognised by International Relations (IR) specialists and commentators confronted by the question of the discipline, relevance to policy formulation. International Relations can add to assessment practitioners’ knowledge and skills base since it is steeped in theory, deals with issues affecting all levels of society and investigates numerous concerns. Concepts and views from the discipline I will discuss are change, interactive processes, everyday international political economy and agential power and governability. The main question is what is the substance of these views and concepts and how can they assist the assessment practitioner? Throughout, I will indicate the relevance of the views and concepts, to assessment processes with practical examples. © 2016 South African Association of Political Studies.", ,1.0
361,A Fuzzy Logic Technique for the Environmental Impact Assessment of Marine Renewable Energy Power Plants,"The application of fuzzy logic to environmental impact assessment (EIA) provides a robust method to address uncertainties and subjectivities inherent in evaluating complex environmental systems. This is particularly relevant in ocean renewable energy projects, where predicting environmental impacts is challenging due to the dynamic nature of marine environments. We conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify the types of impacts currently being investigated, assessed, and monitored in existing marine energy conversion projects. Based on these foundations, we developed both traditional and fuzzy mythologies for EIA. The fuzzy logic methodology approach allows for the incorporation of uncertainties into the assessment process, converting qualitative assessments into quantifiable data and linguistic levels and enhancing decision-making accuracy. We tested this fuzzy methodology across four types of ocean energy devices: floating, submerged, fixed to the ocean floor, and onshore. Finally, we applied the methodology to the EIA of a marine energy project in the Cozumel Channel, Quintana Roo, Mexico. The results demonstrate that fuzzy logic provides a more flexible and reliable evaluation of environmental impacts, contributing to more effective environmental management and sustainable development in marine renewable energy contexts. © 2025 by the authors.", environmental impact; fuzzy logic; ocean renewable energy,1.0
362,Spatial targeting of agri-environmental measures: Cost-effectiveness and distributional consequences,"Agri-environmental measures are payments to farmers to reduce environmental risks or to preserve cultivated landscapes. These measures are codified in European Union regulations. Poor spatial targeting is one of the major causes of low cost-effectiveness in agri-environmental measures. Existing studies on spatial targeting focus primarily on selected individual measures; hence, they do not allow for conclusions at the program level, where the planning and implementing of decisions on a number of different measures has to be made. In this study, we analyzed the impacts of two spatial targeting options (targeting of erosion-reducing measures on erosion vulnerable areas; targeting of grassland extensification on N-pollution vulnerable areas) on the cost-effectiveness of the single measures and the entire agri-environmental program of the federal state of Brandenburg in Germany. The methodological steps included an analysis of empirical data on land use and program participation, an expert-based environmental impact assessment and a spatial allocation procedure based on linear programming. The environmental impact assessment delivered goal-specific index values for each measures-land parcel combination expressing the suitability of the measures for contributing to four regionally relevant program objectives. The cost-effectiveness of the measures and the program were calculated by putting budgetary costs in relation to the achieved environmental index sum. The calculated cost-effectiveness of the program in 2006 was 89.6% of the simulated optimal cost-effectiveness. The spatial targeting of erosion-reducing measures on erosion vulnerable areas caused an increase in the cost-effectiveness at the measures level and almost no changes at the program level. The spatial targeting of grassland extensification on N-pollution vulnerable areas, despite also improving the cost-effectiveness of this measure, had negative effects on the cost-effectiveness of the program. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", CAP; N-pollution; Payments for environmental services; Soil erosion,1.0

364,EIA Practices in the Natural Gas Extraction Sector in Tanzania: Does Local Community Contribution Matter?,"Community participation is an important element for implementation of various development projects including Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes. However, involvement of the local community in contributing to the EIA processes is minimal. This paper sought to explore local community contribution in the EIA practices in the natural gas extraction sector in Tanzania. Household survey, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and document review were employed in this study. Findings revealed that the majority of respondents have inadequate understanding of the EIA process and therefore undermine its significance, their role and contribution towards the exercise. Procedures for engaging the community were also lacking according to standard measure practices. Various factors emanating from policy implementers, EIA consultants and the community were attributed to low participation. Views and opinions of participants were not considered during implementation of the gas exploration and extraction project which left communities dissatisfied with implementers and practitioners. Therefore, implementation of the EIA policy in regard to procedures should be emphasised to ensure adherence for smooth and effective community participation in the EIA processes. This will guarantee respect for community contribution and mainstreaming of suggestions in the implementation of natural gas exploration and extraction projects to avoid adverse effects and reduce on mitigation consequences. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.", EIA; Local community; natural gas extraction; participation,1.0
365,Factors influencing groundwater contamination near municipal solid waste landfill sites in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau,"Effective management of municipal solid waste (MSW) is essential for the conservation of ecosystems in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Considering the landfill is the major method of MSW management, the factors influencing groundwater contamination near MSW landfill sites in the QTP were studied, based on field investigations, environmental impact assessment, and meteorological and hydrogeological analyses. Results indicated that the groundwater was contaminated heavily by nitrate (PI = 7.5), particularly in the landfill without an anti-seepage system, followed by nitrite (PI = 3.5) and heavy metals including arsenic (PI = 4.1) and hexavalent chromium (PI = 2.8). Total hardness, total dissolved solids, nitrate, and lead in the groundwater near the investigated landfill sites were significantly different between the monsoon and the cold seasons. Both the rainfall infiltration and the leachate infiltration were considerably limited by environmental characteristics in the QTP, including high evaporation, low rainfall, and the presence of permafrost. Soil sample contamination near landfill sites was considered as moderate (28.6% of the soil samples) and moderate to heavy (71.4% of the soil samples), based on the geoaccumulation index of mercury. However, comparatively low generation and concentrations of leachate and good topsoil quality (PI = 0.84) reduced the quantity of pollutants infiltrating into the groundwater. The alkaline leachate (pH = 7.45–9.23) and soil (pH = 7.08–8.72) also considerably decreased the concentrations of contaminants dissolved in the infiltrated rainfall and leachate. Additionally, low groundwater level can delay preferential ﬂow and enhance attenuation. Therefore, the groundwater contamination near the landfill sites was simply point pollution, which was influenced by leachate, soil, climate, and hydrogeology characteristics in the QTP. The anti-seepage system is a potential strategy for use in the prevention of groundwater contamination by MSW landfills in the QTP. © 2021", Groundwater contamination; Influencing factor; Municipal solid waste landfill; Qinghai-Tibet plateau; Soil contamination,1.0
366,"Snow chemistry in the flin flon area of Manitoba, 1981-1984","The March snowpack was sampled at seven sites along two 40 km transects southeast and south southeast of the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Co. smelter in Flin Flon, Manitoba, Canada, from 1981 to 1984. The purpose was to determine deposition patterns of smelter emissions to use in environmental impact assessment. Zinc deposition decreased with distance from the smelter according to an inverse curvilinear relationship, thus implicating the smelter as the source. Prevailing northwest winds resulted in higher deposition in the southeast than in the south southeast direction. Snowpack monitoring responded effectively to the reduction in emissions which occurred when a new electrostatic precipitator was installed. There is no evidence that sulphate-S in the snow originated from smelter emissions even though there were up to 800 tonne day-1 of SO2 emitted. The pH of the snow decreased with distance from the smelter and was positively correlated with heavy metals. pH was not correlated with sulphate deposition. Snow monitoring was an effective and sensitive tool for determining snowpack chemistry and air pollutant dispersion around the smelter at Flin Flon. © 1986 D. Reidel Publishing Company.", ,0.0
367,Analysis of Trends in Marine Water Quality Using Environmental Impact Assessment Monitoring Data: A Case Study of Busan New Port,"Various development projects, including harbor construction, are carried out in coastal areas. In South Korea, the performance of environmental impact assessment (EIA) is legally required for development projects in marine areas to monitor the impacts of these projects on offshore marine environments. National Marine Environmental Measurement Network (NMEMN) data can be used to examine the overall status of the marine environment prior to a development project, but these data are very limited. In contrast, EIA data are collected from a large number of locations over various periods. The purpose of this study was to analyze trends in the coastal marine environment using NMEMN and EIA data collected in 2010-2011 for Busan New Port, where multiple development projects are underway. Use of the combined dataset enabled more effective analysis of trends in marine water quality, including those in dissolved oxygen, the chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), than did the use of NMEMN data alone. Values increased in the bottom layer, especially in the summer, after port operation had begun. For example, average summer ranges for COD, TN, and TP in the bottom layer in 2000-2005 were 1.41-2.2 mg/L, 0-0 μg/L, and 0-17.62 μg/L, respectively, and those in 2006-2011 were 1.53-3.2 mg/L, 0-281 μg/L, and 8.09-49.35 μg/L, respectively. In the future, data from various sources should be integrated into EIAs to identify not only the impacts of a single project, but also the overall impacts of multiple changes in an area.

368,The environmental impact assessment of drainage systems: a case study of the Karun river sugarcane development project,"Saline water can be drained from the plant root zone by developing a drainage network; therefore, the lack of control strategies for soil salinity and the subsurface water level will result in high salinity and nutrient concentrations. In large drainage systems, this issue becomes more important due to the large amount of water drained into the environment. Therefore, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) should be conducted before undertaking such developments. Due to the importance of wetlands that may be affected by the sugar cane fields located in Khuzestan Province in Southern Iran, the EIA process was implemented to evaluate this project. Three scenarios of a pre-drainage system development, drainage system development without management issues, and drainage system development with management issues are considered to help reduce the amount of water drained and protect the wetland. The scaling weighting checklist method was used to categorize the data and to ensure that no potential influence was overestimated. The results show the necessity of the application of management practices and drainage system development to protect the Shadegan International Wetland.

369,Progress with Implementing the Environmental Assessment Requirements of the Resource Management Act in New Zealand,"The Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) has introduced environmental impact assessment (EIA) into the operations of territorial authorities at the regional and district level in New Zealand. The system established by the RMA is not only devolved in administrative terms, it is also comprehensive in its application. This paper reports the findings of an interview-based survey of key personnel in selected regional and district councils, along with others from government departments, planning consultancies and law firms. The purpose is to assess the success of the councils in developing appropriate and workable procedures, and to identify the main problems likely to inhibit the development of an effective EIA system in New Zealand. Overall, the task of implementing the EIA requirements has been tackled positively by councils, but there are signs of major differences emerging in the EIA procedures they are developing. Key issues that need to be considered by councils include: the need for explanatory documentation for, and verbal advice to, resource consents applicants at the earliest stage possible; the lack of public involvement in the EIA activities and the need for council staff to encourage and facilitate such participation; and problems with ensuring the adequacy of EIA information in such a devolved and comprehensive EIA system. © 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

370,Compensatory mitigation and screening rules in environmental impact assessment,"Concerns about the effectiveness of environmental impact assessment (EIA) have prompted proposals to improve its performance by limiting the discretion of decision-makers in screening. To investigate whether such proposals are likely to generate the desired results, we conducted an evaluation of the screening process under the Australian government's EIA regime from its introduction on 16 July 2000 to 30 June 2013 (study period). Almost 1 in 5 'particular manner' decisions-a type of screening decision under the regime-were found to be unlawful. The extent of non-compliance is explained on the basis of convenience. The department was required to assess a large number of projects under tight timeframes and with limited resources, while being pressured by proponents to allow their projects to bypass EIA. These pressures resulted in the development of an informal custom whereby the formal compensatory mitigation restrictions were frequently ignored. The results highlight the relative significance of formal and informal institutions in EIA. Formal EIA rules typically provide a mere outline of the process. The informal institutions adopted by administrators often have a greater influence on how the process operates and what it achieves. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.", Administrative discretion; EIA; Environmental impact assessment; Implementation theory; Institutionalism; Screening,1.0
371,"Geo-environmental impact assessment and management information system for the mining area, Northeast China","The reliability and validity of mining geo-environmental impact assessment strongly depend on the availability of large volumes of high-quality investigation data and an effective evaluation methodology. Combining all the data in a coherent and logical structure supported by a computing environment helps ensure validity and availability. The study’s main objectives were twofold: environmental impact assessment and the development of a managing software tool. The study identifies geo-environmental impacting factors with a relational map, evaluates geo-environmental impact degrees with a comprehensive environmental impact assessment index calculated by the Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy neural network (TSFNN) model, and classifies assessment results into three categories: slight, moderate, and heavy. Furthermore, a routine management system was developed for mining geo-environmental information managers and officials based on a client/server model and component-based Geographic Information System (GIS) secondary development technology. The system has five main capabilities: mine enterprise and geo-environment information management, GIS map display and analysis, data querying and statistical analysis, geo-environmental impact assessment and classification, and document query and management. To verify the software’s performance, Changchun–Jilin–Tumen Economic Area in Jilin Province, Northeast China was selected for application. As validation, 96.23 % of TSFNN model evaluation results are the same as those of the Improved Analytic Hierarchy Process (IAHP) model. The results indicate that 64.15 % of the study area mine sites are moderately damaged and 7.5 % heavily damaged. The software provides an effective tool for geo-environmental information managers and can be applied by local governments for geo-environmental impact assessment and to design sustainable development guidelines for the mining area. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", Geo-environmental impact assessment; Geo-environmental information management; GIS secondary development; Mining area; T–S fuzzy neural network,1.0
372,Sustainable urban development and the challenge of policy integration: An assessment of planning tools for integrating spatial and environmental planning in the Netherlands,"Over the last 10-15 years, urban planners in the Netherlands have been given more policy space for defining area-specific environmental ambitions, in an attempt to promote further the integration of environmental and urban planning. This increased policy space has offered new opportunities, but also poses new challenges for urban planners. Urban planners often appear to struggle with the issue of how to come to an operationalization of area-specific urban environmental quality. Various planning tools exist that can assist planners with these tasks. In this paper we distinguish between 'substance-oriented' tools such as environmental impact assessments and 'process-oriented' tools that facilitate interaction and consensus building among planners and stakeholders. Recently, in the Netherlands, a distinct type of 'hybrid' planning tool has been developed specifically for defining area-based environmental ambitions in spatial plans, coupled with the development of measures for attaining these ambitions. However, little research has been conducted into how these planning tools perform in practice and how this can be understood, especially in comparison with more traditional 'substance-oriented' and 'process-oriented' planning tools. In this paper we assess the added value of the new hybrid tools on the basis of an analysis of three exemplary case studies. Although the tools seem to be helpful in assisting urban planners to better integration of environmental and spatial planning, there are some aspects that deserve more attention, including the identification of financial consequences of environmental ambitions, and guidelines for dealing with controversies. Future research is recommended into the influence of the hybrid tools on their sociopolitical contexts, their performance in comparison with other hybrid planning tools, and their effective design. © 2008 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.", ,1.0
373,Environmental impact assessment as a planning tool,"The Environmental Impact Assessment process is examined in the light of planning and decision-making theory and found to have three important shortcomings. First, it does not encourage monitoring and modification of environmental protection measures, but relies on uncertain predictions. Second, there is a mismatch between the needs of the proponent and those of reviewers. And, third, land use planning is an essential prerequisite for effective EIA. The Management Programme approach used in Western Australia, and the integrated planning and assessment legislation in New South Wales are described, and proposals for a more satisfactory system outlined.", ,1.0
374,Application of the environmental impact assessment provisions under the BBNJ Agreement in high seas marine protected area: challenges and suggestion,"Once the BBNJ Agreement enters into force, its environmental impact assessment (EIA) provisions will apply to high seas marine protected areas (MPAs). This paper examines current treaties and practices within four high seas MPAs and finds that the EIA provisions established by United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) are ambiguous. The BBNJ Agreement, however, reflects a strong commitment to improving EIA laws and practices in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). Despite this progress, several challenges may arise in implementing the BBNJ Agreement’s EIA provisions in high seas MPAs. These include potential fragmentation when members of the international frameworks or bodies (IFBs) of high seas MPAs do not ratify the agreement, uncertainties surrounding the “not undermine” proviso, and ambiguities in the “due regard” principle. Additionally, the Clearing-House Mechanism (Cl-HM) under the BBNJ Agreement requires further development to cooperate with the institutions of high seas MPAs, and the fragmented EIA standards, subjects and procedures for high seas MPAs complicate the determination of equivalency with those under the BBNJ Agreement. Moreover, the EIA provisions for existing high seas MPAs appear limited. It is worth mentioning that the practices of the EIA in high seas MPAs may not be sufficient. This paper offers several recommendations for the above challenges: encouraging non-Parties to apply the EIA provisions under the BBNJ Agreement, putting forward a possible interpretation or understanding for the “not undermine” proviso and “due regard”, developing the CL-HM through the BBNJ Secretariat, and developing EIA guidelines for high seas MPAs, supported by the Scientific and Technical Body set by the BBNJ Agreement. Furthermore, members of the IFBs of high seas MPAs should enhance their EIA practices to ensure effective application of the BBNJ Agreement’s provisions in the future.

375,Using the ecosystem service approach to determine whether jatropha projects were located in marginal lands in Ghana: Implications for site selection,"The concept of marginal land is often used to justify land availability and inform land allocation for biofuel projects. However, marginal lands can provide other valuable ecosystem services. Using interviews with multiple stakeholders and fieldwork in three collapsed biofuel projects in Ghana, this paper shares perspectives on how the ecosystem service approach (ESA) can offer a better basis for selecting land for biofuel projects. Expert interviews with key stakeholders (e.g. Lands Commission) in biofuel value chains in Ghana highlight the lack of consensus of what constitutes marginal land, with two dominant interpretations coming up; (i) land unsuitable for food production and (ii) land unsuitable for cost-effective agricultural production. Both interpretations however do not reflect the ecosystem services lands provide, as well as the significant cultural values attached to them. Our empirical work shows that many ecosystem services are obtained from the supposedly marginal lands that are neglected from both interpretations, as well as the standard project planning and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes. We make the case that when compared to the current marginal land narrative, the ESA offers a better lens for understanding local land uses, in managing emerging tradeoffs and providing information for locating biofuel projects. Our findings suggest that expanding the scope of EIAs by integrating elements of the ESA can go a long way towards informing site selection for biofuel investments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd", Biofuel; Ecosystem services; Ghana; Jatropha; Marginal land; Site selection,1.0
376,Institutionalizing social impact assessment in Bangladesh resource management: Limitations and opportunities,"Consideration of social issues in environmental impact assessment (EIA) of development projects has been an integral part of project cycle since the inception of EIA in Bangladesh in the early 1990s. This paper examines the emergence of social impact assessment (SIA) in Bangladesh environmental management and its institutionalization. It reveals that although SIA does not have a statutory status like EIA, social dimensions are firmly established in donor funded poverty alleviation projects. It is proposed that SIA is given a clear legislative mandate. The Department of Environment (DOE) - the agency that looks after the implementation of EIA on behalf of the government - needs to be strengthened and transparent in order to play a more effective role. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

377,Towards a systematic framework for the analysis of environmental policy Integration,"Environmental policy integration (EPI) refers to the incorporation of environmental concerns in non-environmental policy sectors. EPI aims to avoid conflicts between environmental and other policy objectives and to enhance environmental policy by directly targeting the driving forces of environmental degradation. In practice, however, the potential of EPI has not been fully utilized. Scientific knowledge of EPI is found in several, largely isolated, bodies of literature (on EPI, climate policy integration and environmental impact assessment/strategic environmental assessment) and does not provide an adequate answer to the question of what EPI strategies work, where and why. A systematic framework based on comparative empirical research is required to contribute to more effective EPI strategies. In this paper we formulate a research agenda for the development of such a framework on the governance of EPI that is robust, i.e. builds on other theories of environmental governance and policy change and that envisages large-scale, international comparative empirical analysis. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.", Climate policy integration; Environmental policy integration; Governance; Mainstreaming,1.0
378,Testing the validity of a commonly-used habitat suitability index at the edge of a species' range: Great crested newt Triturus cristatus in Scotland,"Habitat Suitability Indices (HSI) are widely used in conservation and in pre-development surveying. We tested a commonly-used HSI to assess its effectiveness at predicting the presence of a European protected species, the great crested newt Triturus cristatus, at the edge of its range. This HSI is used to understand species' conservation needs, and in assessing the need for, and designing, mitigation. Given the cost of surveying to developers, it is essential that they can have confidence in the index used in targeting work and in Environmental Impact Assessments. We found that nine of the ten factors which make up the HSI are robust in the region, even in a disjunct population believed to have been isolated for around 3000 years. However, we propose modification of the geographic factor, based upon an improved knowledge of the species' distribution since the HSI was originally devised. © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2017.", Amphibian conservation; Citizen science; Disjunct population; Habitat evaluation procedure; Species distribution,0.0
379,"The method, rights and resources model for evaluation of the effectiveness of environmental impact assessment systems","Background: The need to measure the effectiveness of environmental impact assessment (EIA) systems has been fuelled by the debate over the relevance of EIA systems as environmental management tools. Researchers have developed different models for evaluating the effectiveness of EIA systems. However, the models face the challenges related to objectivity and the quantification of environmental impacts which have restricted the measurement of the effectiveness to procedural evaluation. Objectives: The purpose of this article is to propose and discuss an alternative conceptual and practical model to evaluating the effectiveness of EIA systems. Method: This article reviewed the objectives of EIA systems as enshrined in the Rio Declaration and the Local Agenda 21 to derive the theoretical framework. The concepts of compliance, participation and capacity were identified as important elements of a framework for evaluating both procedural and substantive EIA system effectiveness. Results: Through literature review, the article identified and critiqued models for evaluating EIA systems in terms of objectivity and substantiveness. The method, rights and resources (MRR) model focussed on substantive and procedural effectiveness, objectivity of EIA system effectiveness evaluation and provided a theoretical framework. The MRR model was conceptualised as an indicator-based model. Conclusion: The MRR model introduces a divergence from previous models in that objective evaluation of the effectiveness of EIA systems is built into the EIA system rather than applied externally on the EIA system. © 2017.

380,Implementation of environmental impact assessment in China,"The paper describes major developments of environmental impact assessment (EIA) in China since 2003 when its EIA law became effective, with emphasis on those aspects not sufficiently touched upon by most researchers so far. These range from threshold-based categorization, evolution in scoping, expansion and upgrading of a series of technical guidelines for EIA, addition of water and soil conservation plan to EIA, public consultation and social impact assessment to interaction with other major means of environmental management in China (i.e. total pollution load control, discharge permit and cleaner production). Based on a literature review, exchanges with EIA practitioners and the author's daily work on EIA, it is found that EIA in China has evolved into a fairly comprehensive and technically adequate system. The biggest problem lies in its poor enforcement and implementation, which is the focus of this paper. By examining each practical step in reviewing, enforcing and implementing EIA, the paper evaluates EIA's role in optimizing decision-making (e.g. by alternative analysis), EIA implementation and its supervision piloted in China, underlying technical, procedural and institutional issues and concerns, and the disconnect between project EIA and plan/regional EIA, both with regards to theory and practice. The main reasons for weak EIA enforcement and implementation are discussed, which include the political system and incentive mechanisms, institutional arrangements, and regulatory and methodological shortcomings. Based on the analysis, recommendations are made for improving enforcement and implementation of EIA in China. © Imperial College Press.", China; Environmental enforcement and implementation; Environmental impact assessment,1.0
381,Assessment and comparison of the environmental performances of a regional incinerator network,"In Emilia-Romagna region (Northern Italy) the integrated waste treatment system consists of material collection and recycling, incineration with energy recovery and landfill as final disposal. In particular, at least one incineration plant is working in almost every province of the region. In this work, a screening life cycle assessment approach is applied to seven different incinerators, to compare the different plant technologies and identify the most relevant environmental impacts and processes. The characterization method used in the life cycle impact assessment step is Eco-indicator 99. The functional unit is 1 ton of waste input. As a first result, it can be noted that while the combustion systems are rather similar, the main variables are ascribable to gas cleaning options and efficiency in energy recovery, which result in quite different environmental performances. Among heavy metals, particular attention must be paid to Cd and As, due to their high toxicity, despite their low quantities. The impact due to dioxin emission is orders of magnitude lower than other contaminants (e.g., heavy metals). Furthermore, a catalytic system could be useful for a complete removal of organic contaminants and for a more effective abatement of nitrogen oxides. Finally, the environmental impact assessment sorts the various plants according to their age, i.e., the most recent plants provide the best environmental performances for the same quantity of combusted waste. © 2007.", ,1.0

Whilst few quantitative data exist on this issue, criticism of the EIA process for being too long and costly is a constant theme. We considered 88 completed EIAs. Times for the six key phases of the EIA process were reported, with the longest phase being the production of the environmental impact statement. Data were not available to examine the time taken for each of the three discrete steps that make up this phase, although some questions were posed as the basis for follow-up work. A key question that emerged from looking at the times of this phase and the next two longest phases is how important is scoping in determining any unforeseen delays in EIAs?

383,The seven impediments in invertebrate conservation and how to overcome them,"Despite their high diversity and importance for humankind, invertebrates are often neglected in biodiversity conservation policies. We identify seven impediments to their effective protection: (1) invertebrates and their ecological services are mostly unknown to the general public (the public dilemma); (2) policymakers and stakeholders are mostly unaware of invertebrate conservation problems (the political dilemma); (3) basic science on invertebrates is scarce and underfunded (the scientific dilemma); (4) most species are undescribed (the Linnean shortfall); (5) the distribution of described species is mostly unknown (the Wallacean shortfall); (6) the abundance of species and their changes in space and time are unknown (the Prestonian shortfall); (7) species ways of life and sensitivities to habitat change are largely unknown (the Hutchinsonian shortfall).Numerous recent developments in taxonomy, inventorying, monitoring, data compilation, statistical analysis and science communication facilitate overcoming these impediments in both policy and practice. We suggest as possible solutions for the public dilemma: better public information and marketing. For the political dilemma: red-listing, legal priority listing and inclusion in environmental impact assessment studies. For the scientific dilemma: parataxonomy, citizen science programs and biodiversity informatics. For the Linnean shortfall: biodiversity surrogacy, increased support for taxonomy and advances in taxonomic publications. For the Wallacean shortfall: funding of inventories, compilation of data in public repositories and species distribution modeling. For the Prestonian shortfall: standardized protocols for inventorying and monitoring, widespread use of analogous protocols and increased support for natural history collections. For the Hutchinsonian shortfall: identifying good indicator taxa and studying extinction rates by indirect evidence. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.", Conservation priorities; Ecosystem services; Extinction; Information shortfalls; Science funding; Species diversity,0.0
384,Learning about knowledge management for improving environmental impact assessment in a government agency: The Western Australian experience,"How does knowledge management (KM) by a government agency responsible for environmental impact assessment (EIA) potentially contribute to better environmental assessment and management practice? Staff members at government agencies in charge of the EIA process are knowledge workers who perform judgement-oriented tasks highly reliant on individual expertise, but also grounded on the agency's knowledge accumulated over the years. Part of an agency's knowledge can be codified and stored in an organizational memory, but is subject to decay or loss if not properly managed. The EIA agency operating in Western Australia was used as a case study. Its KM initiatives were reviewed, knowledge repositories were identified and staff surveyed to gauge the utilisation and effectiveness of such repositories in enabling them to perform EIA tasks. Key elements of KM are the preparation of substantive guidance and spatial information management. It was found that treatment of cumulative impacts on the environment is very limited and information derived from project follow-up is not properly captured and stored, thus not used to create new knowledge and to improve practice and effectiveness. Other opportunities for improving organizational learning include the use of after-action reviews. The learning about knowledge management in EIA practice gained from Western Australian experience should be of value to agencies worldwide seeking to understand where best to direct their resources for their own knowledge repositories and environmental management practice. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.", Decision-making; Environmental agencies; Environmental impact assessment; Knowledge management; Organizational learning,1.0

The methodology includes detailed case study analysis involving document analysis and interviews with key stakeholders. The results demonstrate that implementation and enforcement of EIA and environmental licensing still have a long way to go in terms of being fully effective in Brazil. Despite this, in the scope of the case study, the results showed that implementation and enforcement of environmental licensing and EIA regulations and decisions seem to be undertaken according to relevant regulations in the context of the Pan American Village.

386,LCC application in the Polish mining industry,"Purpose - To provide a tool to evaluate the economic and ecological feasibility of new and existing mining projects using a combination of environmental goals expressed in life cycle assessment (LCA) results with economic goals expressed within life cycle costing (LCC). Design/methodology/ approach - Sustainability is developing into a target for an increasing number of industries and governments. As a consequence focus has shifted from the production process to the entire life cycle. LCA is a tool that can help producers make better decisions concerning environmental protection, whereas the aim of LCC analysis is to create a cost-effective model for environmental impact assessment. Findings - Study of the influence of the environmental cost of projects should be based on long-term analysis of environmental investment. Using the life cycle net present value (LCNPV) method it is possible to compare different investment options, and this method can be treated as a tool that can help producers to make better decisions pertaining to environmental protection. Research limitations/implications - Internalisation of external costs and valuation of environmental costs are the biggest problems for LCC calculations. Practical implications - Mining producers can reasonably expect that implementation of LCA and LCC will lead to minimisation of environmental impact of their activities and to more effective environmental, cost and waste management. This means savings through reducing the amount of waste emissions and a decrease in fees and fines. Originality/value - The use of the tools described in this paper will increase the efficiency of the decision-making process, demonstrating the connection between activity and devastation of the environment. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", Investments; Life cycle costs; Mining; Poland; Waste management,0.0
387,Progressing quality control in environmental impact assessment beyond legislative compliance: An evaluation of the IEMA EIA Quality Mark certification scheme,"The effectiveness of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) systems is contingent on a number of control mechanisms: procedural; judicial; evaluative; public and government agency; professional; and development aid agency. If we assume that procedural and judicial controls are guaranteed in developed EIA systems, then progressing effectiveness towards an acceptable level depends on improving the performance of other control mechanisms over time. These other control mechanisms are either absent, or are typically centrally controlled, requiring public finances; this we argue is an unpopular model in times of greater Government austerity. Here we evaluate a market-based mechanism for improving the performance of evaluative and professional control mechanisms, the UK Institute of Environmental Management and Assessments’ EIA Quality Mark. We do this by defining dimensions of effectiveness for the purposes of our evaluation, and by identifying international examples of the approaches taken to delivering the other control measures to validate the approach taken in the EIA Quality Mark. We then evaluate the EIA Quality Mark, when used in combination with legal procedures and an active judiciary, against the effectiveness dimensions and use time-series analysis of registrant data to examine its ability to progress practice. We conclude that the EIA Quality Mark has merit as a model for a market-based mechanism, and may prove a more financially palatable approach for delivering effective EIA in mature systems in countries that lack centralised agency oversight. It may, therefore, be of particular interest to some Member States of the European Union for ensuring forthcoming certification requirements stemming from recent amendments to the EIA Directive. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.", Certification; Effectiveness; EIA Quality Mark; Review,1.0
388,Public participation in environmental impact assessment processes through various channels – Can you listen to us now? Lessons from a Brazilian mining case,"Public participation in Environmental Impact Assessment processes is generally considered to be one of the main safeguards of ensuring access to information and democratization of decision-making processes regarding environmental issues. However, implementation is spotty. Studies highlight problems found within formal processes and so actors also turn to informal channels and other formal channels outside of the EIA process to achieve goals. While most research points to the role of collusion between industry and government (often to the detriment of the environment), civil society actors similarly use other channels (informal and formal outside of the EIA) to influence formal processes in the EIA to help realize improved environmental outcomes. Less is known however about how these channels interact – can they play a complementary role? Using a case study of a proposed mining project in southern Brazil (the Retiro Project), we examine the implementation of public participation processes. Echoing previous research around EIA processes in Latin America, we found that there is a discrepancy between law and practice regarding participation within formal processes within the EIA such as public hearings, leading actors to pursue other channels concurrently (informal and formal outside of the EIA) to influence these decision-making processes. Power asymmetries in the case – like many proposed development projects worldwide including in Brazil and Latin America – suggest that formal channels such as the public hearings within the EIA are not enough to ensure adequate public participation in decision-making. Rather, pursuing various channels of inputting into policy processes, while more complex, can be more effective. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd", Brazil; EIA; Environmental licensing; Mining; Public participation,1.0
389,Environmental impact assessment in the People's Republic of China,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures have been in existence in the People's Republic of China over the last decade. The impetus for China's introduction of EIA was provided by the Environmental Protection Law of the People's Republic of China, which was adopted by the Fifth National People's Congress in 1979. The EIA process, which is administrative and not statutorily mandated, has been applied primarily to construction projects. Four stages are typically involved in an EIA investigation: design of the investigation, evaluation of background environmental quality, prediction of environmental impacts, and an assessment and analysis of the environmental impacts. A variety of approaches is used for predicting and analyzing environmental impacts, ranging from ad hoc methods to fairly sophisticated mathematical models. The results of the EIA investigation are compiled in an environmental impact statement, which is used as the basis for decision making by personnel in environmental protection departments. The EIA process does not include provisions for citizen notification or involvement. Views differ concerning the effectiveness of the EIA program in protecting China's natural, social, and cultural environments. Some hold that the EIA program has brought about improvement in environmental protection, while critics contend that the program has had little effect in the prevention of pollution. However, most, if not all, observers seem to feel that the program should be continued and improved. A major avenue for improvement is to place the evaluation of a particular project in a regional context. © 1990 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.", Effectiveness of EIA; EIA methods; EIA process; Environmental impact statement; People's Republic of China,1.0
390,Aligning public participation with local environmental knowledge in complex marine social-ecological systems,"The incorporation of local and traditional knowledges into environmental governance regimes is increasingly recognised as a critical component of effective and equitable conservation efforts. However, there remain significant barriers to integration of community-based knowledge within mainstream environmental governance. This paper explores community-based knowledge in the context of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), a widely-used governance tool designed to predict and manage the impacts of development. Drawing on a social survey and interviews, the paper documents local community knowledge of environmental changes associated with dredging and the construction of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plants in a large industrial harbour located in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, and compares this knowledge with public consultation opportunities offered throughout the project lifecycle, including during assessment and after project approval. The findings highlight a misalignment between community knowledge of environmental change, which is acquired largely after impacts become apparent, and the public participation opportunities afforded through EIA, which generally occur before construction or dredging is undertaken. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd", Environmental impact assessment; Great barrier reef world heritage area; Marine ecology; Participatory governance; Port development; Water quality,1.0
391,Researchers' perspective on the main strengths and weaknesses of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures,"Core characteristics of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures along with the quality of implementation vary from country to country and sometimes from project to project. However, several issues obstructing EIA's proper implementation are common, such as: national or regional EIA specific regulations, low quality of assessment reports, insufficient equipment and trained staff, inadequate institutional framework, lack of public participation, and low levels of cooperation between policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders. The gap between EIA research and practice is often highlighted in the scientific literature and technical reports; however, data is often limited to particular cases. This paper explores researchers' perspectives on the main strengths and weaknesses of EIA so we may advance recommendations to improve the quality and effectiveness of EIA procedures for more sustainable outcomes. We applied an online survey on EIA strengths and weaknesses to researchers that published at least one paper related to EIA in the last ten years. We use different statistical analyses, network analysis and co-occurrence analysis to investigate the 103 responses received from researchers in the field. Our findings capture researchers' perspectives and could help to change our current traditional approaches. Our results could also help us rethink the EIA collaborative process leading it toward more sustainable holistic planning by learning from past experiences, best practices, and expert opinion. We highlight important EIA researchers' recommendations for improving EIA procedures and the relationship between EIA and the scientific field, and implicitly for improving the quality of the environment and for developing a better EIA strategy. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.", EIA strengths and weaknesses; Environmental Impact Assessment; EU EIA Directive; Research-practice gap; US NEPA,1.0
392,Problems and Challenges on Environmental Law Enforcement in Indonesia: AMDAL in the Context of Administrative Law,"Environmental issues have been increasingly recognized as significant challenges facing Indonesia, as a developing country with a rapidly growing population and a rapidly expanding economy. In recent years, environmental degradation and natural resource depletion have become more acute, resulting in increased pressure on the government to take stronger action to protect the environment. Despite the existence of environmental laws in Indonesia, environmental degradation continues to occur, highlighting the need for better enforcement and stronger legal protections. One of the major environmental problems in Indonesia is deforestation, which is driven by the expansion of agricultural land, mining activities, and logging. This has resulted in significant habitat loss and biodiversity decline, as well as increased greenhouse gas emissions from the loss of forest cover. Additionally, Indonesia’s coastline and marine ecosystems are threatened by pollution from industrial activities and plastic waste, which has adverse effects on marine life and human health. Environmental laws in Indonesia include a range of regulatory measures, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) programs. However, the implementation of these laws is often inadequate, with weak enforcement and a lack of effective penalties for non-compliance. Moreover, corruption and lack of political will have been identified as key factors that hinder the effective implementation of environmental laws in Indonesia. © 2022 Author(s).", Environmental Legal Instrument; Environmental Management; Environmental Problem,1.0

One critical issue of EIA is the representation and handling of uncertain information. Many different theories are available to deal with uncertainty, however, deficiencies exist in these theories. In this paper, based on a more effective representation of uncertainty, called D numbers, a new method is proposed for the EIA problem. In the proposed method, the assessment results of environmental impacts are expressed and modeled by D numbers.

However, there is still a dearth of empirical investigation of EIA practice, hence it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of the EIA process in South Africa. Selected aspects of a random sample of EIAs conducted in the Limpopo Province were investigated, focusing on baseline information, specialist studies, duration taken for projects to be authorised and the record of decision (ROD). In general, with the exception of social baseline information, the frequency and quality of baseline information were satisfactory. The quality of specialist studies (although not normally required for the scoping report) was also satisfactory. Duration of projects was satisfactory with authorisation generally within 12 months. Notably, all applications in the sample received a decision at the scoping phase, without any projects requiring a full Environmental Impact Assessment. Judging by the aspects of EIA investigated, EIA practice in the Limpopo Province is generally well compliant to the regulations and guidelines, but capacity and skill in EIA compilation and review needs to be increased.", Activity category; Baseline information; EIA; Record of decision; Specialist studies,1.0
395,Techno-economic Analysis and Environmental Impact Assessment of a Green Ammonia Synthesis Process Under Various Ammonia Liquefaction Scenarios; [암모니아 액화 시나리오에 따른 그린암모니아 합성 공정의 경제성 및 환경 영향도 평가],"In this study, two different scenarios for ammonia liquefaction in the green ammonia manufacturing process were proposed, and the economic-feasibility and environmental impact of each scenario were analyzed. The two liquefaction processes involved gas-liquid separation before cooling at high pressure (high pressure cooling process) or after decompression without the gas-liquid separation (low pressure cooling process). The high-pressure cooling process requires higher capital costs due to the required installation of separation units and heat exchangers, but it offers relatively lower total utility costs of 91.03 $/hr and a reduced duty of 2.81 Gcal/hr. In contrast, although the low-pressure cooling process is simpler and cost-effective, it may encounter operational instability due to rapid pressure drops in the system. Environmental impact assessment revealed that the high-pressure cooling process is more environmentally friendly than the low-pressure cooling process, with an emission factor of 0.83 tCO2eq less than the low-pressure cooling process, calculated based on power usage. Consequently, the outcomes of this study provide relevant scenario and a database for green ammonia synthesis process adaptable to various process conditions. © 2024 Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers.

396,Evaluation of environmental impact assessment effectiveness in Slovakia,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) practice in Slovakia is about 20 years old. EIA was first introduced in Slovakia based on the Environment Law of 1992. The practice in EIA started developing shortly after the Law No. 127/1994 Coll. came into force. The first group of experts was certified as being EIA/strategic environmental assessment (SEA) professionally qualified persons. During 20 years, the numbers of EIA procedures were performed and number of EIA practitioners has considerably increased. Many discussions arise about EIA procedure effectiveness and quality in Slovakia. The task of this study has been to investigate EIA system applications in Slovakia and evaluate its effectiveness. In this paper, the views of professionally qualified persons are examined closely, using a questionnaire survey. Data from the questionnaires are analysed to find information relating to current EIA/SEA and EIA/SEA practice and the future for EIA. The objective of this study was to assess the potential for improving the effectiveness of EIA in Slovakia, and finally the recommendations for improvement are presented. The results of this research suggest that the use of new legislation should be extended in Slovakia in order to improve EIA effectiveness. © 2014 © 2014 IAIA.", effectiveness; environmental impact assessment; questionnaire survey,1.0
397,Dynamics in central-local division of the authority of EIA approval in China,"In comparison with the dominant ' consideration model', the veto arrangement of environmental impact assessment (EIA) in China is a substantive regulatory feature that empowers environmental authorities to impinge on development activities. However, the anticipated efficacies thereof are compromised by the central-local division of EIA approval. The mismatch between high enforcement rates and prevalent non-compliance shows that EIA approval can be easily circumvented, especially at local levels. Recent mass, blanket devolution in a hasty manner, coupled with enthusiastic local responses in watering down EIA approval, raises serious concerns about its appropriateness and effectiveness. The tendency to deregulate by loosening environmental scrutiny and the reinvention of EIA procedures in light of project licensing processes impairs the veto effects of EIA approval. Without formal legislative empowerment in the central-local framework and individualised regulatory impact analysis, the current devolution approach is bound to endanger environmental quality and undermine the legitimacy of the veto arrangement. © 2019 The Author(s).

398,"A typology of stakeholders and guidelines for engagement in transdisciplinary, participatory processes","This paper fulfils a gap in environmental management by producing a typology of stakeholders for effective participatory processes and co-design of solutions to complex social-environmental issues and then uses this typology for a stepwise roadmap methodology for balanced and productive stakeholder engagement. Definitions are given of terminology that is frequently used interchangeably such as ""stakeholders,"" ""social actors,"" and ""interested parties."" Whilst this analysis comes from a marine perspective, it is relevant to all environments and the means of tackling environmental problems. Eleven research questions about participative processes are addressed, based on more than 30 years of experience in water, estuarine, coastal, and marine management. A stepwise roadmap, supported by illustrative tables based on case-studies, shows how a balanced stakeholder selection and real engagement may be achieved. The paper brings these together in the context of several up-to-date concepts such as complex, nested governance, the 10 tenets for integrated, successful, and sustainable marine management, the System Approach Framework and the evolution of DPSIR into DAPSI(W)R(M) framework. Examples given are based on the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, the Water Framework Directive, the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, the Framework Directive for Maritime Spatial Planning, as well as for Regional Sea Conventions. The paper also shows how tools that have been developed in recent projects can be put to use to implement policy and maximize the effectiveness of stakeholder participation. © 2016 Newton and Elliott.", Coastal and marine management; Implementation of MSFD; Stakeholders; Transdisciplinary research,1.0
399,Environmental diagnosis methodology to analyze landfill-associated risks in Colombia,"Colombia generates 27,000 tonnes/day of waste, which is deposited into landfills. Approximately 30% of these sites do not comply with the requirements to be considered for controlled landfills. According to the legal framework, these disposal systems of solid waste are compelled to carry out an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process in order to minimize their associated problems. Even though there are tools designed to perform the EIA prior to the landfill construction, this is not the case for the follow-up and control stages of the operation phase. The University of Granada (Spain) developed a diagnosis methodology called EVIAVE, which allows for quantifying-through indexes-the environmental impact of landfills according to location and exploitation conditions, which allows for the implementation of environmental management plans. EVIAVE was designed for municipal landfills according to the European Union's legal framework. However, it has been successfully applied in Chile, Venezuela and Iran with adaptations regarding their legal, socio-economic and ecosystem features. This work shows EVIAVE's adaptation in Colombia, in order to diagnose active landfills. Modifications include flora and fauna, which allow for obtaining a wider description of the environment and updating the methodology according to the Convention on Biological Diversity. The assessment of environmental descriptors was also reformulated to cover the concept of vulnerability. This enables having more accuracy when assessing the predisposition of environmental elements to potential impacts generated by landfills' operations. EVIAVE's application in 16 Colombian landfills allowed for identifying the affected elements due to operation and maintenance conditions. This facilitates decision-making processes regarding the environmental management plans. It can be concluded that this methodology is a feasible and effective tool to diagnose the state of the environment in a landfill's influence area, and to analyze landfill-associated risks in Colombia, because it takes into account environmental threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the follow-up and the control stages in EIA processes. © 2015 WIT Press.", Environmental Impact Assessment; EVIAVE methodology; Follow-up; Waste management,1.0
400,Administrative infraction of Environmental Impact Assessment Avoidance: Criteria and effectiveness of the procedures of the Superintendence of the Environment; [Infracción administrativa de elusión al Sistema de Evaluación de Impacto Ambiental: Criterios y eficacia de los procedimientos de la Superintendencia del Medio Ambiente],"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) avoidance is an infraction that has been primarily regulated in the Organic Law of the Superintendence of the Envi-ronment (LOSMA) and, more recently, in law number 21.595 on economic crimes. This study focuses on EIA avoidance as an administrative infraction (article 35, letter b of the LOSMA) and on the procedures that the Superintendence of the Environment (SMA) uses to address it. The Superintendency of the Environment (SMA) employs two discre-tionary procedures to address this infraction: a regular punitive procedure and a special procedure known as «requirement for submitting to EIA». Both procedures serve dif-ferent purposes: the first one aims to impose a sanction (with a punitive and deterrent objective), while the second aims to ensure compliance with regulation by subjecting avoidant activities to EIA without imposing a penalty (with a corrective objective). This discretionary power has been recognized by jurisprudence based on the administrative principles of opportunity, efficiency and effectiveness. The objective of this study is to analyze the value of the requirement for submitting to EIA procedure. This, from the perspective of achieving its corrective purpose and to assess whether it can serve the broader interests of the SMA’s supervisory work. It questions whether it is acceptable to solely demand the submission of a project in avoidance to EIA, mitigating the punitive function and its deterrent effect regarding this kind of infraction. © (2023), (Universidad de Chile.

401,Automatic Object Removal With Obstructed Façades Completion Using Semantic Segmentation and Generative Adversarial Inpainting,"Automatic object removal with obstructed façades completion in the urban environment is essential for many applications such as scene restoration, environmental impact assessment, and urban mapping. However, the previous object removal typically requires a user to manually create a mask around unwanted objects and obtain background façade information in advance, which would be labor-intensive when implementing multitasking projects. Moreover, accurately detecting objects to be removed in the cityscape and inpainting the static obstructed building façade to obtain plausible images are the main challenges for this objective. To overcome these difficulties, this study addresses the object removal with the façade inpainting problem from the following two aspects. First, we proposed an image-based cityscape elimination method for automatic object removal and façade inpainting by applying semantic segmentation to detect several classes, including pedestrians, riders, vegetation, and cars, as well as using generative adversarial networks (GANs) for filling detected regions by background textures and patching information from street-level imagery. Second, we proposed a workflow to filter unoccluded building façades from street view images automatically and tailored a dataset for the GAN-based image inpainting model with original and mask images. Furthermore, several full-reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics are introduced to evaluate the generated image quality. Validation results demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed method, and the synthetic image is visually realistic and semantically consistent. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

402,Multi-criteria GIS-based siting of an incineration plant for municipal solid waste,"Siting a municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plant requires a comprehensive evaluation to identify the best available location(s) that can simultaneously meet the requirements of regulations and minimise economic, environmental, health, and social costs. A spatial multi-criteria evaluation methodology is presented to assess land suitability for a plant siting and applied to Santiago Island of Cape Verde. It combines the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to estimate the selected evaluation criteria weights with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for spatial data analysis that avoids the subjectivity of the judgements of decision makers in establishing the influences between some criteria or clusters of criteria. An innovative feature of the method lies in incorporating the environmental impact assessment of the plant operation as a criterion in the decision-making process itself rather than as an a posteriori assessment. Moreover, a two-scale approach is considered. At a global scale an initial screening identifies inter-municipal zones satisfying the decisive requirements (socio-economic, technical and environmental issues, with weights respectively, of 48%, 41% and 11%). A detailed suitability ranking inside the previously identified zones is then performed at a local scale in two phases and includes environmental assessment of the plant operation. Those zones are ranked by combining the non-environmental feasibility of Phase 1 (with a weight of 75%) with the environmental assessment of the plant operation impact of Phase 2 (with a weight of 25%). The reliability and robustness of the presented methodology as a decision supporting tool is assessed through a sensitivity analysis. The results proved the system effectiveness in the ranking process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.", AHP; Environmental impact; MSW incinerator; Multi-criteria evaluation; Pollutant dispersion; Siting; Visibility,1.0
403,The effectiveness of Ghana’s environmental impact assessment regulations to achieve green growth,"Achieving green growth requires that development projects with potential environmental impacts undergo a rigorous environmental impact assessment process to address negative consequences. The attainment of green growth, and consequently the Sustainable Development Goals, depends on an effective Environmental Impact Assessment regime. In Ghana, this regime must ensure that projects strictly adhere to the guidelines outlined in the Environmental Assessment Regulations, LI 1652, and LI 1703, before commencement. This research examines the effectiveness of Ghana’s environmental assessment regulation in protecting the environment to achieve green growth. Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders, including officials from the Environmental Protection Agency, environmental consultants, and environmental impact assessment proponents in the Eastern Region of Ghana. The findings from these engagements revealed several major challenges in Ghana’s environmental assessment regulations that hinder full compliance before projects begin. These challenges include: 1) A shortage of local experts, 2) Insufficient logistics for the EPA’s monitoring and evaluation department to conduct frequent inspections, 3) Lack of intervener funding, 4) Poor coordination among government agencies, and 5) Delays in the EIA process. © 2024 IAIA.", Environmental governance; environmental impact assessment; Ghana; green growth; sustainable development,1.0
404,Lost at SEA? Environmental assessment and offshore oil and gas planning in Brazil,"Early assessment of environmental issues is key for sound decision-making about licensing of offshore oil and gas exploration sites. In this paper, we recall the historical background of such early assessments in Brazil showing that a simple consultation process in place for the last 15 years was able to steer oil and gas exploration away from sensitive areas. A more structured SEA-type instrument was designed in 2012, but its actual contribution to the effectiveness of early assessments remains to be seen as the first assessment reports are still to be delivered. Recent changes in the institutional and political context in Brazil have enabled the new government to ignore both the established consultation process and the ongoing SEA-type process. This shift of orientation led to the inclusion of environmentally sensitive areas in bidding rounds in 2019. Following this government decision, various initiatives to preserve the recommendations from the previous consultation process have illustrated the relevance of environmental/impact assessment not only to ease decision-making processes but also as a tool to safeguard environmental protection. © 2020, © 2020 IAIA.", Brazil; Environmental impact assessment (EIA); offshore oil and gas; planning; Strategic environmental assessment (SEA),1.0
405,Can Italian wines outperform European benchmarks in environmental impact? An examination through the product environmental footprint method,"Nowadays, there is a pressing demand for precise tools to quantify sustainability and assess the contributions of products and processes to sustainable development. This requirement extends to the wine industry as well. In 2013, the European Commission introduced the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF), providing a standardized methodology grounded in life cycle thinking for evaluating the environmental impacts of products across various industries. Despite its potential and the availability of specific guidelines for wine, the application of PEF remains unexplored in the sector. This study contributes to the knowledge by applying PEF to assess environmental impacts of Italian still and sparkling wines production, identifying variations from European benchmarks. Additionally, it aims to pinpoint pivotal hotspots and provide guidance for effective mitigation strategies. Average data from 27 wines certified as sustainable under Italian VIVA program, were collected and used to perform a life cycle assessment in accordance with PEF protocol. Results revealed that Italian still wines exhibited a greater environmental impact than the European reference value, while sparkling wines displayed a slightly more favourable environmental performance compared to the European average. Notably, specific impact categories remained consistent across different wines and countries, with climate change, resource utilization, land use, and particulate matter harmful for human health accounting for nearly 80 % of the overall environmental footprint. Hotspot analysis identified the plantation/destruction of vines, energy usage in the winery, and packaging as significant factors influencing the environmental footprint of Italian wines. Addressing these elements could enhance the environmental competitiveness of the Italian wine sector relative to its European counterparts. However, to validate these findings, further studies are necessary, both within Italy and in other European wine-producing regions. Such research initiatives will improve and strengthen PEF methodology, bolstering its adoption as the primary tool for environmental impact assessment of wine at the community level. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.", Environmental assessment; LCA; Sparkling wine; Still wine; Sustainability,0.0
406,Appraising affected community perceptions of implementing programs listed in the environmental impact statement: A case study of Nickel smelter in Indonesia,"The environmental impact assessment (EIA) follow-up program that involved an indigenous community can verify the effectiveness of a project's mitigation measure. This research is a case study of Indonesia's nickel smelter that examines community perceptions on executing programs listed in the environmental impact statement (EIS). We used bivariate regression models to explore the link between the perceived sustainable programs and subset socio-demographic variables at the individual level. The questionnaire survey (n = 370) indicated that community views underscored the implementation of programs on environmental dimensions; however, they were satisfied with the programs’ results on economic and social dimensions. The respondents’ job background was consistently a top-ranked and positively tied to the respondents’ opinions on the effectiveness of programs. Overall, the study provides insights into how the community's feedback for the EIA follow-up may lead to benefits regarding the project's corrective actions as well as provide inputs to the government to decide relevant permits, contracts, or other legally binding documents. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd", Environmental impact assessment follow-up; Indigenous community; Nickel smelter; Perceptions; Sustainability,1.0
407,A process-based evaluation framework for environmental impacts of policy making,"Policy making is a highly interactive process with environmental systems. Evaluation of policy's potential environmental impacts has been regarded as an efficient precautionary measure to avoid unexpected losses and environmental risks. One of the greatest challenges is how to streamline the policy-making process through an integrated evaluation approach. This paper formulated a process-based framework for environmental impact assessment of policy making (PB-EIA), by integrating policy problem identification, environmental impact assessment, and policy cost-effectiveness evaluation. Using China's wastewater resource utilization (WWRU) policy as a case study, the institutional, technological, and economic constraints or limitations related to wastewater resource utilization were identified, and the potential environmental impacts of policy implementation on energy consumption and carbon emissions were evaluated. The expected ecological and environmental benefits of the WWRU policy were supposed to be significant, and the cost of recycled water was relatively low compared with other unconventional water resources in China. Furthermore, significant variations in the environmental impacts and policy effectiveness were found across different sectors and regions. According to the evaluation results, some recommendations for supporting policy improvements and follow-up policy implementations were proposed. The specific technical procedures and application of PB-EIA were also discussed. This study demonstrates that the process-based framework can effectively incorporate environmental considerations into policy-making processes and promote sustainable development. © 2023", Environmental impact assessment; Policy effectiveness evaluation; Policy evaluation; Policy making; Wastewater resource utilization,1.0

Through the investigation of the planning EIA results of 586 national industrial parks, the achievements of the industrial park planning EIA system in improving the environmental management system, optimizing the scale and layout of the parks, and promoting the industrial upgrading, pollution prevention and ecological environment protection were systematically summarized. In addition, the practical problems faced in the process of planning EIA were comprehensively sorted out, and the fundamental reasons for the confusion in planning EIA review subjects and the lack of dynamic and effective management were deeply analyzed. According to the current situation and requirements of the planning EIA, countermeasures and suggestions were put forward, such as strengthening the top-level design to clarify the review subject, promoting the implementation of the planning EIA by classification, and using the numerical control platform to strengthen effective supervision, so as to improve the effectiveness of the industrial park planning EIA. © 2022 The Author(s).", achievements; countermeasures; existing problems; national industrial park; planning EIA; suggestions,1.0
409,Method of Carbon Emission Environmental Impact Assessment for Coal Power Construction Projects: A Case of Yellow River Basin; [煤电行业建设项目碳排放环境影响评价技术方法研究：以黄河流域为例],"The coal power industry is the main source of carbon dioxide and air pollutant emissions in the Yellow River Basin. Therefore, incorporating the carbon emission impact assessment of the coal power industry into the existing environmental impact assessment (EIA) system can effectively promote the coordinated reduction of environmental pollution and carbon emissions. Based on the main influencing factors of carbon emissions in the coal power industry, this study designs an index system that covers the entire carbon emissions process. Based on this index system, differentiated evaluation benchmarks are designed, considering advanced technologies and standards. A carbon emission impact evaluation method that primarily relies on constraint-based assessment and also provides guidance is then developed. Based on the proposed method, by applying the core evaluation indicator, that is carbon emissions performance, the carbon reduction potential of existing coal power facilities, and the proposed coal power facilities planned for construction in the ‘14th Five-Year Plan’ period in the Yellow River Basin is evaluated. The analysis suggests that by optimizing project design, it is expected that carbon emissions from the existing coal power units in the basin will be reduced by 12.7% and 27.1% reduction in the incremental carbon emissions of new coal power units planned for the ‘14th Five-Year Plan’ period could be expected. Specifically, regions with a relatively high proportion of new coal power units, such as Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi, might achieve 30.7% and 23.0% reduction in carbon emissions, respectively. The study demonstrates that there is substantial potential for carbon emissions reduction in the basin. It is recommended to focus on areas with poor carbon emission performance in the basin, and promote comprehensive management of the coal power industry through measures such as phasing out small coal units and replacing low-carbon clean fuels. Additionally, it is recommended to establish a management ledger for synergetic technologies and issue guidelines for assessing the carbon emissions impact of the coal power industry to provide effective policy tools for synergizing pollution and carbon reduction in new coal power projects. © 2024 Editorial Board, Research of Environmental Sciences.

410,Integrating mine closure planning with environmental impact assessment: challenges and opportunities drawn from African and Australian practice,"Best practice mine closure planning and environmental impact assessment (EIA) principles share many common features. This research examined how mine closure planning relates to, and can be integrated with EIA by comparing practice in eight African and Australian jurisdictions. Emphasis was placed on key challenges and opportunities associated with: institutional arrangements for mine closure planning; financial mechanisms for mine site closure and rehabilitation including abandoned/legacy mine sites; transparency of mine closure planning and financing provisions; and regulation of artisanal and small-scale mining activity. Data were gathered through document analysis, interviews and interactions with practitioners from Western Australia, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia. Issues associated with mine closure planning and rehabilitation under existing arrangements and opportunities for improvement through existing EIA processes already in place in each jurisdiction are explored. All eight jurisdictions have appropriate regulatory provisions in place already, but implementation capacity remains a challenge. Opportunities for effective practice lie in using mine closure planning and EIA measures in an integrated fashion, avoiding duplication and enabling synergies in management to be realised. © 2016 IAIA.", artisanal and small-scale mining; environmental impact assessment; Mine closure planning; mining securities; rehabilitation,1.0

412,Application of a GIS-based modeling system for effective management of petroleum-contaminated sites,"A GIS-aided simulation (GISSIM) system is developed for effective management of petroleum-contaminated sites in this study. The GISSIM contains two components: an advanced three-dimensional (3D) numerical model, and a geographical information system (GIS). The modeling component undertakes simulation for the fate of contaminants in subsurface unsaturated and saturated zones. The GIS component is used in three areas throughout the system development and implementation process: (1) managing spatial and nonspatial databases; (2) linking inputs, the model, and outputs; and (3) providing an interface between the GISSIM and its users. The system is applied to a North American case study. Concentrations of benzene, toluene, and xylenes in groundwater under a petroleum-contaminated site are dynamically simulated. Conditions of the contamination in different time stages under a variety of remediation scenarios are predicted. Reasonable outputs have been obtained and presented graphically. Implications of the modeling outputs have been analyzed based on the local environmental regulations. They provide quantitative and scientific bases for further assessment of site-contamination impacts and risks, as well as decisions of practical remediation actions.

413,Phytoremediation of landfill leachate,"Leachate emissions from landfill sites are of concern, primarily due to their toxic impact when released unchecked into the environment, and the potential for landfill sites to generate leachate for many hundreds of years following closure. Consequently, economically and environmentally sustainable disposal options are a priority in waste management. One potential option is the use of soil-plant based remediation schemes. In many cases, using either trees (including short rotation coppice) or grassland, phytoremediation of leachate has been successful. However, there are a significant number of examples where phytoremediation has failed. Typically, this failure can be ascribed to excessive leachate application and poor management due to a fundamental lack of understanding of the plant-soil system. On balance, with careful management, phytoremediation can be viewed as a sustainable, cost effective and environmentally sound option which is capable of treating 250 m3 ha-1 yr-1. However, these schemes have a requirement for large land areas and must be capable of responding to changes in leachate quality and quantity, problems of scheme establishment and maintenance, continual environmental monitoring and seasonal patterns of plant growth. Although the fundamental underpinning science is well understood, further work is required to create long-term predictive remediation models, full environmental impact assessments, a complete life-cycle analysis and economic analyses for a wide range of landfill scenarios. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, adjustments and even changes in relation to the original project are usual when construction starts, what calls for an adaptive approach to environmental management, especially in sensitive environments. This paper addresses the mitigation and management of adverse impacts during the construction of the descending roadway of the Imigrantes highway, which crosses a protected area of tropical rainforest featuring steep slopes in São Paulo State. Through periodical field inspections, coupled with monitoring data provided by the contractor, the real impacts on the physical environmental were assessed during a three years period. The assessment procedure, which could be applied to similar projects, classified the impacts in three categories, according to a set of specified attributes, and set up criteria to evaluate the results of mitigation measures. Out of 100 impacts, mostly related to the execution of large tunnels and viaducts in steep slopes, 68% were classified as significant or very significant. Most of 36 mitigation measures, effectively reduced the magnitude of the main physical impacts, showing the need of the follow-up phase of the EIA process to ensure effective environmental protection.", Environmental follow-up; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental supervision; Imigrantes highway; Mitigation measuers; Physical environment,1.0
415,EIA effectiveness in Vietnam: key stakeholder perceptions,"In line with its rapidly transforming economy, thousands of development proposals undergo Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in Vietnam each year. Since its inception in 1993, Vietnam's EIA system has undergone numerous amendments via a suite of legislative reforms to the Law on Environmental Protection (LEP) and its associated Circulars and Decrees, a testament to the Government's will to improve environmental performance. Here we evaluate the effectiveness of Vietnam's EIA system through a unique empirical study focusing on those engaged in the EIA system undertaken in Hanoi in 2016 comprising 20 semi-structured interviews with respondents from government, NGOs, academia, and industry. By evaluating the effectiveness of the EIA system in Vietnam from the stakeholder perspective, this paper aims to identify where, how, and why the EIA system is effective or otherwise. Stakeholders vary in their perceptions of the system. Those external to it identified several inhibiting characteristics. Results suggest that like other developing countries and jurisdictions, Vietnam's EIA procedural performance falls short of EIA goals. Criticisms of discordant dual planning law and environmental management laws, fragmented decision making, conflicts of interest in appraisal committee appointments, and information deprivation that impedes public participation suggest that like other developing countries and jurisdictions, Vietnam's EIA performance, in practice, faces several challenges that potentially undermine its role in environmental protection.

416,Air quality management in Botswana,"This paper examines air pollution situation and the history of air quality management in Botswana. The current air quality management in Botswana is still largely underpinned by the Atmospheric Pollution Prevention Act of 1971, supplemented by the more recently enacted legislations such as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Act of 2010 and the Ambient Air Quality - Limits for Common Pollutants of 2012 published by the Botswana Bureau of Standards. Though commendable efforts have been made toward legislating against air and other forms of pollution, these have not yielded expected results in view of the prevailing levels of air pollutants like sulphur dioxide and fine particulate matters in the country's atmospheric environment. Legislation as a sole measure may not be effective in tackling this challenge. Rather, government should also address some root-causes of the problem by making policies and programmes that will reduce unemployment and increase the earning capacity of citizenry. This will, among other things, effectively check poverty-induced biomass burning in the country. The paper looks at some other challenges of air pollution management and suggestions are made to tackle the identified problems.", Air pollutants; Atmosphere; Carbon monoxide; Environment; Mining; Nitrogen dioxide; Sulphur dioxide,1.0
417,"Environmental Impact Assessment of Housing Colonies in Lucknow City, India with Special Reference to Land Capability and Spatial Development Using AHP and GIS","In the absence of proper assessment of environmental significance of ongoing housing projects in India’s developing cities, the living standards of urban and rural area are fast deteriorating. Poor performance has been noticed in the follow-up activities in environmental impact assessment (EIA). This is considered to be a major weakness of EIA not only in Indian cities but also in those developing cities that are transitioning. This study uses the EIA framework to evaluate current and future environmental impacts on developing housing projects in Lucknow and also evaluates the post-project issues. Urban suitability analysis is introduced to the EIA process on land use planning to evaluate the suitability of housing colonies. Pre-project baseline information is collected from the EIA reports, whereas the post-project compliance is studied through primary data collection. Conflict analysis is carried out to explore disagreements between urban suitability, enabling infrastructure and master plan 2021 proposed by land authorities using satellite imageries, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and sub-models within the framework of environmental assessment. The outcome of this study reveals that EIA regulations are not adequately implemented in housing projects and there are conflicts with respect to post-project compliance. The study further reveals that zoning regulations and land use suitability is not accounted for while deciding upon housing projects. The methodology provides a cost-effective rapid land evaluation framework which may help policy makers, urban and regional planners and researchers working in developing countries to understand the dynamics of urban growth and implications of these housing projects on the environment. © 2015, © 2015 National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA).", EIA; fuzzy AHP; GIS; land capability; master plan; spatial development,1.0

This reactor system allows precise temperature control, continuous pH monitoring, and controlled dosing of reagents to optimize reaction conditions. Detailed characterization was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), BET (specific surface area) analysis, point of zero charge (PZC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the SCR, SCRT, and 5%Fe@SCRT materials. For Malachite Green adsorption, SRCT demonstrated a maximum adsorption capacity of 39.78 ± 0.5 mg/g using the Langmuir isotherm model and followed pseudo-second-order kinetics. Optimum conditions for adsorption were found to be: an initial concentration of 50 ppm, an adsorbent dosage of 1 g/l, a pH of 8.5, and a temperature of 50°C. For the catalytic oxidation of phenol, 5%Fe@SRCT achieved a remarkable removal rate of 99.9 ± 0.1% under optimum conditions (50 ppm phenol, 1 g/l catalyst dosage, pH 3.5, H2O2 concentration 8.7 mM, and temperature 70°C). Intermediates identified during the reaction included hydroquinone, benzoquinone, catechol, and resorcinol, with degradation occurring over a 60-minute reaction period. The 5%Fe@SCRT material showed excellent reusability in the removal of phenol by catalytic oxidation, with no significant loss of efficiency over three cycles, while the SRCT underwent three cycles of regeneration for the adsorption of Malachite Green. Scavenger tests confirmed the involvement of hydroxyl radicals in the catalytic oxidation process. In addition, fish survival tests after catalytic oxidation of phenol by 5%Fe@SRCT showed no impact on fish, underlining the environmental safety of this process. In addition, germination tests after decolorization of MG by SRCT demonstrated a good effect with no negative impact, reinforcing the ecological value of this innovative technology. These results highlight the innovative use of SCRT and 5%Fe@SCRT as versatile materials for environmental remediation, exploiting their effective adsorption capacities and efficient catalytic oxidation performance within the proposed double-walled borosilicate glass reactor system. Practitioner Points: The study demonstrates the effectiveness of an innovative reactor system employing SRCT adsorbent and Fe@SRCT catalyst for efficient removal of malachite green and phenol from wastewater. Environmental impact assessment, including seed germination and fish survival evaluation, validates the method's eco-friendly potential. Implementation of this approach could significantly contribute to sustainable water treatment practices. © 2024 Water Environment Federation.", adsorption; clay rock; impregnation; oxidation; reactor; toxicity,0.0
419,"Examining Environmental Impact Assessments and Participation: The Case of Mining Development in Dullstroom, Mpumalanga, South Africa","South African democracy witnessed considerable effort to redefine Environmental Impact Assessment regulations to improve participation of citizens towards sustainable development activities. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of participatory processes has generally been mixed and in many cases fallen below expectations, with lack of empirical evidence especially in South Africa to understand the underlying elements that may contribute to poor public participation in Environmental Impact Assessments. This paper attempts to investigate the participatory inefficiencies of Environmental Impact Assessments for mining development specifically in Dullstroom, Mpumalanga and presents viewpoints from key stakeholders. Results indicate that Environmental Impact Assessments especially for mining development are conducted as tokenistic tools to approve developments rather than to genuinely engage with the concerns of interested and affected groups. There is a need for environmental practitioners to be impartial during assessments, including the independence of government as regulator and enforcer of environmental assessment processes rather than spearheading mining development for economic development.

420,"Strategic environmental assessment: One concept, multiple forms","Several approaches to strategic environmental assessment (SEA) have been developed recently, differing, for example, in openness, scope, intensity and duration. Differences stem from the specific contexts in which the SEA processes are meant to be used. This is illustrated with two current SEA processes in the Netherlands for drafting legislation (environmental test), and for plans and programmes (strategic environmental impact assessment). Although design for purpose enhances the effectiveness of SEA, the variety of approaches may also lead to confusion among non-SEA experts, such as politicians and other senior decision makers, about what SEA is. This could create an impediment to the acceptance and development of SEA in situations where currently no obligation for it exists.

421,Are appeals an indicator of EIA effectiveness? Ten years of theory and practice in WA,"When enacted the Environmental Protection Act 1986 (WA) (EPAct) was acclaimed for providing political independence in environmental decision-making, and innovative broad avenues for public appeal. Over its ten year history the EIA process contained therein has undergone numerous changes including the enactment of an amending statute, two instances of court challenges and a variety of reviews and administrative alterations. The EPAct is again undergoing major review and as such it is now timely to revisit WA's EIA legislation and to consider the validity of performance indicators. This article traces the history of the EPAct and examines one aspect thereof: the statutory appeals system within the Western Australian environmental impact assessment procedure. The public statutory appeals provisions within the Act have in the past been used as an indicator of the health of the system of EIA in WA. This study examines trends in appeals and suggests that the use of appeals as an indicator of a system of EIA's effectiveness must be treated with great caution. It is found that a high number of appeals can be interpreted to indicate either an accessible system of objection, or alternatively to demonstrate community disenchantment therewith and distrust thereof. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", ,1.0
422,"Reduce, Reuse, Resilient? Life-Cycle Seismic and Environmental Performance of Buildings with Alternative Concretes","This paper investigates the impacts of alternative structural concretes on the life-cycle sustainability and resilience of a reinforced concrete building in a high seismic region. To do so, we conduct a life-cycle environmental impact assessment, quantifying greenhouse gas emissions associated with building construction and seismic performance, accounting for potential earthquake damage and subsequent repairs. The unit of analysis is a modern code-designed reinforced concrete frame building, designed with seven different types of concrete: a conventional concrete mix, 3 concrete mixes in which varying quantities of fly ash replace cement, and 3 concrete mixes in which varying quantities of recycled concrete replace virgin coarse aggregate. The findings suggest that replacing cement with fly ash can be an effective tool to improve building sustainability over the entire life cycle, reducing greenhouse gas emissions during both construction and service life (seismic) life-cycle stages, without compromising seismic performance (i.e., resilience). However, replacing virgin coarse aggregate with recycled concrete aggregate can have unintended consequences in terms of worsening seismic performance and hence making the overall life-cycle sustainability calculus unfavorable in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. This paper is one of the first to link life-cycle seismic and environmental performance of buildings designed with alternative (and potentially green) concretes and to demonstrate the importance of considering tradeoffs between resilience and sustainability in design and selection of alternative structural materials. In addition, this study illustrates a framework that can be applied for life-cycle assessment and evaluation of structural concrete material choices. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.", ,0.0
423,Developing an Environmental Impact Assessment Methodology for Disc Golf Courses,"The demand for outdoor recreational activities is rising. Therefore, it is important to pay more attention to their environmental impact and sustainability. However, there is a lack of methodology for measuring the impact of novel recreational activities, such as disc golf. This research aimed to address the existing environmental problems with disc golf in Estonia and elaborate on the methodology for assessing the environmental impact of disc golf courses and using it as a teaching tool for rising environmental awareness of the students. Based on existing research, the environmental impact assessment methodology for disc golf areas was developed and tested. The developed methodology is relevant for discovering negative impacts and for minimizing them. It could be used as an assessment tool for service providers and destination managers. Using the methodology as practical exercise proved to be an effective tool for rising the student's environmental awareness.  © 2023 Marika Kose et al., published by Sciendo.", Carrying capacity; disc golf; environmental impact assessment; higher education; methodology development; sustainability,1.0
424,Conceptualising sustainability assessment,"Sustainability assessment is being increasingly viewed as an important tool to aid in the shift towards sustainability. However, this is a new and evolving concept and there remain very few examples of effective sustainability assessment processes implemented anywhere in the world. Sustainability assessment is often described as a process by which the implications of an initiative on sustainability are evaluated, where the initiative can be a proposed or existing policy, plan, programme, project, piece of legislation, or a current practice or activity. However, this generic definition covers a broad range of different processes, many of which have been described in the literature as 'sustainability assessment'. This article seeks to provide some clarification by reflecting on the different approaches described in the literature as being forms of sustainability assessment, and evaluating them in terms of their potential contributions to sustainability. Many of these are actually examples of 'integrated assessment', derived from environmental impact assessment (EIA) and strategic environmental assessment (SEA), but which have been extended to incorporate social and economic considerations as well as environmental ones, reflecting a 'triple bottom line' (TBL) approach to sustainability. These integrated assessment processes typically either seek to minimise 'unsustainability', or to achieve TBL objectives. Both aims may, or may not, result in sustainable practice. We present an alternative conception of sustainability assessment, with the more ambitious aim of seeking to determine whether or not an initiative is actually sustainable. We term such processes 'assessment for sustainability'. 'Assessment for sustainability' firstly requires that the concept of sustainability be well-defined. The article compares TBL approaches and principles-based approaches to developing such sustainability criteria, concluding that the latter are more appropriate, since they avoid many of the inherent limitations of the triple-bottom-line as a conception of sustainability. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

425,A new approach for environmental risk assessment,"Environmental problems, such as global warming, the limited supply of sustainable energy, the depletion of natural resources, hazardous emissions released into the atmosphere and waste, are increasing global concerns. Therefore, individuals, communities, and businesses need to address environmental protection and sustainability. Environmental impact assessments are needed to identify, mitigate, and control aspects that affect the environment or a company's products, services, or activities. In this study, a general environmental aspect and impact assessment approach, which can be applied to any company that is involved in the production or service sector, is created. An environmental impact pattern that consists of 10 main and 32 sub-categories was formed based on the ISO 14001, environmental studies and field applications. The developed approach was applied to the dyeing units of a manufacturing firm. Sixteen environmental aspects were identified and assessed using the environmental impact template via the environmental failure mode and effect analysis (E-FMEA) method. The developed-approach can be applied to each sector, which will enable us to perform a detailed analysis of the environmental aspects in the environmental impact category. This approach provides a checklist for the environmental impact studies of businesses and has been pioneered as an effective method for company resources to improve their environmental performance. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", E-FMEA; environmental impact; risk assessment,1.0
426,Family-level AMBI is valid for use in the north-eastern Atlantic but not for assessing the health of microtidal Australian estuaries,"Analysis of benthic macroinvertebrate samples at a higher taxonomic level than species, e.g. family, potentially provides a more cost-effective protocol for environmental impact assessments and monitoring as it requires less time, funds and taxonomic expertise. Using the AMBI database, species ecological group scores are shown to be coherent within families. Faunal data from a wide range of environmental impact scenarios in the north-eastern Atlantic demonstrate that AMBI, calculated from mean values for families, exhibits a strong linear relationship with species-level AMBI, the correlation improving by using square-root transformed rather than untransformed abundances. In many regions of the world, however, the sensitivity of benthic macroinvertebrates to environmental perturbations is unknown, precluding the use of AMBI for environmental assessments. Yet the families are essentially the same as in the AMBI database. The utility of family-level AMBI is tested using data for four south-western Australian estuaries previously subjected to environmental quality assessments, but where only 17 species of the 144 taxa are included in the AMBI database. Although family-level AMBI scores reflect differences in environmental quality spatially and temporally within an estuary, they do not follow variations in environmental quality among estuaries. Indeed, south-western Australia estuaries are numerically dominated by families with high AMBI scores, probably due to the detrimental effects of natural accumulations of organic material in estuaries with long residence times. As taxonomic distinctness follows trends in environmental quality among estuaries, as well as temporally and spatially within a system, it provides an appropriate substitute for assessing the 'heath' of microtidal estuaries. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", Benthic macroinvertebrates; Environmental impact assessment; Microtidal estuary; Organic accumulation; Residence time; Taxonomic level,1.0

428,Development of a preliminary environmental risk assessment system by using text mining for introducing alien crops,"Changes in worldwide crop trends and climate change has increased the introduction of alien crops. However, there are always potential side effect issues related to introduced crops, such as the introduced crop becoming a nuisance at the new country or bringing insect pests or microorganisms with the introduced crops. In this study, we developed a crop introduction risk assessment system using text mining method to prevent this problem. First, we designed the “Preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment Index for Alien Crops” based on ecological researches to assess the risks of introduced crops to the natural environment. The questionaries evaluate the target alien crop with previous cases reporting the target crops' adverse effects on the environment, the potential of target crops' direct or indirect damage on the environment. The index has sixteen questions with allocated scores that are divided into 4 categories. The detailed rationales of the questionaries and the assessment index are discussed in main text. Second, we assessed 67 crop species that were introduced or scheduled to be introduced to South Korea with this Preliminary Assessment Index. The literature and data were collected with JabRef, search engines, and from the documents of six international institutions. Finally, based on the preliminary assessment results of selected species, we developed the protocols and a manual for the preliminary environmental risk assessment of introduced species. Final evaluation scores for risk evaluation for introducing crops are suggested (over 70 total score for ‘danger’ and over 50 points for ‘caution required’, and under 50 points for ‘low expected impact’). Presented crop introduction risk assessment system is effective to identify potential problem making crop species. The protocols and a manual that we provide in this study could be applied to other countries which have similar climate and environmental conditions, or after being adequately modified to their environmental factors such as climate, neighboring countries, major crops according to eating habits, and major vegetation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd", Alien crop; Environmental impact; Introduction; Risk assessment; Text mining,0.0
429,Compensating white-tailed eagle mortality at the Smøla wind-power plant using electrocution prevention measures,"Environmental impact assessment allows for compensation of environmental injuries in the form of resource-based restoration projects. Given that compensation is a desired policy at a given site, this study suggests an interdisciplinary scaling method (Resource Equivalency Analysis) that relies on a nonmonetary bird-year metric to quantify and value the impact on human welfare from ecosystem service loss. The lost value associated with white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) turbine collisions at the Smøla windpower plant (debit) in central Norway is compensated through white-tailed eagle electrocution-prevention measures at nearby power lines (credit), scaled using the same bird-yearmetric. We found that 172 actual and projected white-tailed eagle turbine collisions (2005-2027) led to a debit of 3,454 discounted bird-years, which captures lost life expectancy discounted to present value. Field searches indicated that annual whitetailed eagle electrocution mortality per electric distribution pole (or pylon) at Smøla ranges from 0.002 to 0.014 (2009-2011). We suggest that retrofitting between 348 and 2,209 pylons at a present-value cost of US$1.2-7.9 million (2011 at 3%) will provide equivalent value and thus compensate the public for their welfare losses. Improved electrocution probability models will improve cost-effectiveness of retrofitting as a compensatory measure. Although Resource Equivalency Analysis may provide an approach for scaling a biodiversity offset, it cannot address the inevitable environmental trade-offs required in assessing the social profitability of choosing to compensate at a particular site. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.", Electrocution rates; Environmental compensation; Equivalency analysis; Haliaeetus albicilla; No net loss; Turbine collision; White-tailed eagle,1.0
432,Public participation: How can we make it work for the environmental impact assessment system in Thailand?,"Currently, in Thailand, proposed development projects require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as part of the approval process. Effective public participation in the process of developing an EIA helps to ensure fairness and equity for the EIA system. It enables stakeholders to share information and exchange views concerning the complex issues and likely impacts of the proposed development project. Thailand has substantial legislation and regulations that aim to enable public participation for EIA processes. However, implementation of public participation provisions is failing at least to some degree.

433,Evaluation of a gradient sampling design for environmental impact assessment,"Before-After Control Impact (BACI) sampling designs are commonly used in environmental impact assessment and are considered the most effective for detecting changes due to anthropogenic disturbances. These designs handle local spatial variability through randomized placement of samples into a treatment stratum and a control stratum. When a contaminant disperses with distance from a point source it is suggested that a 'gradient' design will be more sensitive to change than randomized placement of samples. This requires allocating samples according to distance, rather than by random placement within randomly placed blocks. In this paper gradient versus random sampling designs were compared using data from an oil field in the North Sea. The gradient sampling design was more powerful than a randomized CI sampling design.", BACI design; Environmental impact assessment; Power of sampling,1.0
434,Screening for environmental impact assessment projects in England: What screening?,Previous survey research into screening for environmental impact assessment (EIA) in England has found that few local authorities have very much experience of dealing with EIA projects. This research examined actual case files of projects that fall within the ambit of the UK's EIA Regulations and found an explanation for this lack of experience. In the majority of the cases examined they were not even screened to see if an EIA was required. This suggests that there is widespread misunderstanding of the EIA regulatory requirements by English local planning authorities. It is also suggested that there may be a culture of resistance to EIA among planners and that this can undermine both EIA effectiveness and the theories used to justify its use. © IAIA 2011., Development control; Environmental impact assessment; Planning; Screening,1.0
435,A spatially intelligent public participation system for the environmental impact assessment process,"An environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a decision-making process that evaluates the possible significant effects that a proposed project may exert on the environment. The EIA scoping and reviewing stages often involve public participation. Although its importance has long been recognized, public participation in the EIA process is often regarded as ineffective, due to time, budget, resource, technical and procedural constraints, as well as the complexity of environmental information. Geographic Information System (GIS) and Volunteer Geographic Information (VGI) have the potential to contribute to data collection, sharing and presentation, utilize local user-generated content to benefit decision-making and increase public outreach. This research integrated GIS, VGI, social media tools, data mining and mobile technology to design a spatially intelligent framework that presented and shared EIA information effectively to the public. A spatially intelligent public participative system (SIPPS) was also developed as a proof-of-concept of the framework. The research selected the Tehachapi Renewable Transmission Project (TRTP) as the pilot study area. Survey questionnaires were designed to collect feedback and conduct evaluation. Results show that SIPPS was able to improve the effectiveness of public participation, promote environmental awareness and achieve good system usability. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.", Environmental impact assessment; GIS; Public participation; VGI,1.0
436,An agent based environmental impact assessment of building demolition waste management: Conventional versus green management,"Waste materials generated from building demolition have become a great challenge to sustainable urban development due to its consumption of the limited landfill spaces, water pollution, energy consumption and harmful gas emissions. Proper management of demolition waste (DW) is a complex process and requires systematic thinking and analysis. Many methods have been proposed to study the environmental impact assessment of demolition waste management (DWM). However, it is found that the currently available studies pay little attention from the perspective of complex adaptive system (CAS) to consider the attitude and interaction of the heterogeneous stakeholders as well as the importance of green DWM which has a great influence on the effectiveness of DW management. The aim of this research is to simulate and explore how the change of attitude and the dynamic interaction among heterogeneous stakeholders can influence the environmental performance of DWM. To achieve this aim, a model for evaluating the environmental impact of DWM was developed by using an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach. The main factors considered in the model are the ratio of green deconstruction (i.e., building deconstruction) managers vs. conventional demolition (i.e. building destruction) managers, the ratio of green design managers (i.e. design for deconstruction) vs. conventional design managers, and the interaction behavior of heterogeneous stakeholders following the herd theory. In the model, the environmental impact assessment was quantified into four categories i.e. land resources, water resources, air resource and energy resources. The proposed model is demonstrated by using the data drawn from the Chinese construction industry. The results reveal that if the deconstruction method and the deconstruction oriented design are widely adopted by architects and engineers, the negative environmental impacts generated by DW can be reduced by at least 50%. Furthermore, the results provide valuable information for government departments to make decisions on how to improve environmental performance of DWM. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd", Agent-based modeling; Deconstruction; Demolition waste; Demolition waste management; Environmental impact assessment,1.0
437,Life-cycle impacts of shower water waste heat recovery: case study of an installation at a university sport facility in the UK,"Recovering heat from waste water discharged from showers to preheat the incoming cold water has been promoted as a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and low-carbon design option which has been included in the UK’s Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) for demonstrating compliance with the Building Regulation for dwellings. Incentivized by its carbon cost-effectiveness, waste water heat exchangers (WWHX) have been selected and incorporated in a newly constructed Sports Pavilion at the University of Brighton in the UK. This £2-m sports development serving several football fields was completed in August 2015 providing eight water- and energy-efficient shower rooms for students, staff, and external organizations. Six of the shower rooms are located on the ground floor and two on the first floor, each fitted with five or six thermostatically controlled shower units. Inline type of WWHX were installed, each consisted of a copper pipe section wound by an external coil of smaller copper pipe through which the cold water would be warmed before entering the shower mixers. Using the installation at Sport Pavilion as the case study, this research aims to evaluate the environmental and financial sustainability of a vertical waste heat recovery device, over a life cycle of 50 years, with comparison to the normal use of a PVC-u pipe. A heat transfer mathematical model representing the system has been developed to inform the development of the methodology for measuring the in-situ thermal performance of individual and multiple use of showers in each changing room. Adopting a system thinking modeling technique, a quasi-dynamic simulation computer model was established enabling the prediction of annual energy consumptions under different shower usage profiles. Data based on the process map and inventory of a functional unit of WWHX were applied to a proprietary assessment software to establish the relevant outputs for the life-cycle environmental impact assessment. Life-cycle cost models were developed and industry price book data were applied. The results indicated that the seasonal thermal effectiveness was over 50% enabling significant energy savings through heat recovery that led to short carbon payback time of less than 2 years to compensate for the additional greenhouse gas emissions associated with the WWHX. However, the life-cycle cost of the WWHX is much higher than using the PVC pipe, even with significant heat recovered under heavy usage, highlighting the need to adopt more economic configurations, such as combining waste water through fewer units, in order to maximize the return on investment and improve the financial viability. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.", Domestic hot water; Hot water shower system modeling; Life-cycle cost; Life-cycle environmental assessment; Showers; Sport facilities; Waste heat recovery; Water heat exchanger,0.0

439,"Combined use of the hydraulic and hydrological methods to calculate the environmental flow: Wisloka river, Poland: case study","The scarcity of water can result in a direct conflict between the protection of aquatic resources and water use. For many agencies, environmental flow (EF) methods are essential in environmental impact assessments and in the protection of important fisheries resources. The objective of this paper is to compare selected hydrological and hydraulic methods and determine the scientifically acceptable and cost-effective way to environmental flow within a section of a mountain river with high naturalness, on the example of the Wisłoka. In this paper, environmental flow was calculated using conventional hydrological methods: Tennant’s, Tessman’s, flow duration curve and hydraulic methods, wetted perimeter method (WPM) and method based directly on ichthyofauna habitat requirements (spawn and migration). The novelty is the combined use of the hydraulic and hydrological methods which relates to flow hydraulics based directly on ichthyofauna habitat conditions. The hydraulic methods provide lower values of environmental flow in comparison with the hydrological methods. The key issue in the use of the hydraulic methods is the choice of criteria. The development of the required set of parameters while taking into account their seasonal nature shifts the method toward habitat modeling methods. However, the scope of habitat requirements of ecosystems must be defined, including the set of aquatic organisms and watercourse type before a hydraulic method may be widely used. Being generally low-cost and simple, the methods presented in this paper can be applied in the water management legislative process. © 2019, The Author(s).", Ichthyofauna habitat requirements; River morphology; Tennant method; Tessman method; Wetted perimeter method,1.0
440,Environmental DNA metabarcoding of benthic bacterial communities indicates the benthic footprint of salmon aquaculture,"We evaluated benthic bacterial communities as bioindicators in environmental impact assessments of salmon aquaculture, a rapidly growing sector of seafood industry. Sediment samples (n = 72) were collected from below salmon cages towards distant reference sites. Bacterial community profiles inferred from DNA metabarcodes were compared to reference data from standard macrofauna biomonitoring surveys of the same samples. Deltaproteobacteria were predominant in immediate vicinity of the salmon cages. Along the transect, significant shifts in bacterial community structures were observed with Gammaproteobacteria dominating the less-impacted sites. Alpha- and beta-diversity measures of bacterial communities correlated significantly with macrofauna diversity metrics and with five ecological status indices. Benthic bacterial communities mirror the reaction of macrofauna bioindicators to environmental disturbances caused by salmon farming. The implementation of bacterial eDNA metabarcoding in future Strategic Framework Directives is an alternative cost-effective high-throughput biomonitoring solution, providing a basis for management strategies in a matter of days rather than months. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd", Bacterial communities; eDNA metabarcoding; Environmental monitoring; Salmon aquaculture,1.0
441,Utilization of fine concrete waste as a lightweight aggregate via granulation: Technical and environmental assessment,"The reutilization of construction and demolition (C&D) waste alleviates the waste disposal problem and significantly reduces environmental pollution. However, fine concrete waste from various sources, such as, ready-mix plants and precast elements, is often considered a low economic value material and left for landfill. Considering a sustainable environment, material recycling should be increased in place of landfilling. The present study explores the utilization of these fine concrete wastes as aggregate material in construction via different granulation processes. The waste material used for in this study replicates the real practical situation in the construction industry. Different manufactured aggregates were characterized for their intended performance in concrete and then lightweight concrete (LWC) was made. A commercial lightweight aggregate (LWA), LECA was also considered for the characterization and concrete production by itself and combination with manufactured aggregates. Moreover, a life cycle assessment was conducted by following ISO 14040-44 guidelines to evaluate the environmental impacts within the aggregate manufacturing process as well as in concrete production. A cradle-to-gate analysis was conducted to estimate the global warming impact (GWI) and cumulative energy demand (CED) for different manufactured aggregates and finally at the concrete level. It was observed that the manufactured aggregates via the granulation process were suitable for LWC and were comparable with commercial LECA. Although the manufactured aggregates were heavier than LECA, a combination of 50% manufactured aggregate and LECA can be suggested. Moreover, the environmental impact assessment ensures the most effective granulation option for the utilization of fine C&D waste in new concrete. The calculated land conservation from utilizing C&D waste in construction shows additional benefits towards achieving sustainability. © 2023 The Authors", Construction and demolition waste; Environmental impact; Fine concrete waste; Granulation; LCA; Light weight aggregate,0.0
442,Cementitious characteristics and environmental behaviour of vitrified MSW incineration fly ash slag,"Although vitrification of municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWIFA) is an energy-intensive process, it is a highly effective method to achieve detoxification and produce a vitrified MSWIFA slag (VFAS). This study presents cementitious characteristics and environmental behaviour of VFAS as a partial ordinary Portland cement (OPC) replacement in mortars. The hydration behaviour, mechanical properties, heavy metals leaching and environmental impacts of the produced mortars were evaluated. The experimental results showed that the leaching levels of lead (Pb) and chloride in VFAS were significantly lower than those of the original MSWIFA, and it can be considered as a non hazardous material. Regarding hydration behaviour, the replacement of 30% OPC by VFAS can accelerate early cement hydration, however obtaina relatively low cumulative heat of hydration. It took a long time to achieve a comparable OPC mortar strength at high VFAS replacement levels. Thus, VFAS can be regarded as a type of slowly reactive supplementary cementitious material (SCM). Moreover, using VFAS in mortars yielded a decrease in the global warming potential and non-renewable energy by an environmental impact assessment. This implies that using VFAS as SCM in cement based materials would be more sustainable for achieving carbon neutrality. © 2022 The Authors", Cementitious behaviour; Heavy metals leaching; Incineration fly ash; Municipal solid waste; Vitrification,0.0
443,The level and nature of sustainability for clusters of abandoned limestone quarries in the southern Palestinian West Bank,"The question of how sustainable a mining site is at the end of its operational life has been somewhat unanswered. The fundamental problem has been how to evaluate the sustainability of a mining site once operations cease and is abandoned. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is certainly a way to evaluate sustainability of such sites, but only through inference and subjective evaluation. This is because the topic of sustainability still hotly debated, and is predominantly focussed on an anthropocentric approach. Even with quantitative-based EIAs, the question is how to directly evaluate sustainability from the data available using a consistent quantitative approach rather than on a case-by-case basis or subjective evaluation. However, by using the ideas and concepts concerning the coupled relationship between the environment and humans prevalent in sustainability science, the question of what is and how to evaluate sustainability has become capable of being answered. Based on previous work of the author in the development and application of a mathematical model of sustainability, the paper applies the model to the results of a quantitative EIA evaluation for nine clusters of abandoned limestone quarries located in the southern Palestinian West Bank. The results indicate that seven of the nine clusters were deemed to be unsustainable, whilst the other two clusters were considered as sustainable at a very weak level only. The results are discussed within the broader context of the coupled environment-human system using one of the supporting frameworks for the development and application of the mathematical model of sustainability: Earth System Analysis. Within this context, the discussion indicates the fact that unmanaged impacts by humans has created the situation for unsustainability to occur. The paper therefore provides for the clearest indication yet of the nature of sustainability at the end of the mining operational life-cycle without an effective and proper management strategy or policies. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.", Abandoned Quarries; Coupled Environment-human systems; Environmental impact assessment; Mathematical Model; Palestinian west bank; Sustainability,1.0

On the basis of considering the constraining factors of regional resources and environment and analyzing the environmental impacts of the planning implementation, by using the methods of checklists, expert consultation, ArcGIS vector overlay, scenario analysis and pressure-state-response analysis, a set of EIA index system suitable for high-pollution and energy-intensive industrial park planning was proposed from the aspects of environmental quality, ecological protection, resource utilization, pollution discharge, risk prevention and control, carbon emissions, centralized governance, and environmental management. Through the determination of the indicator system, the industrial orientation, scale, layout and pollution prevention measures of the planning were optimized and adjusted from the perspective of the ecological environment, which could guide the green and high-quality development of industrial parks. Also, it had specific reference significance for other industrial parks to carry out planning environmental impact assessment. © 2022 The Author(s).", EIA for planning; green; high-pollution and energy-intensive; high-quality development; index system; industrial park; resources and environmental carrying capacity,1.0
445,An evaluation of EIA system performance in Turkey in the context of procedural effectiveness,"Purpose: In Turkey, where the environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been applied since 1993, there have been numerous amendments in the legal and administrative process of the EIA. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of those amendments to the EIA process. Design/methodology/approach: This paper evaluated EIA system performance in the context of procedural effectiveness in Turkey from the day implementation was begun. From its beginning to the present day, the positive and negative developments at the EIA process in Turkey caused by the amendments were evaluated and at which stages. Measures recommended increasing the effectiveness of each of the EIA systems were also identified. Findings: As the EIA Directive first came into force in the USA in 1970, EIA procedures have been widely adopted throughout the world. Although it has been implemented for many years, expectations regarding the EIA process have still not been realized which has forced countries to conduct studies to increase the effectiveness of the EIA process. Turkey, like other countries that are implementing the EIA, acknowledges that the EIA is a significant impact assessment tool and continues its studies to implement this system effectively. In this respect, in Turkey, where the EIA has been applied since 1993, there have been numerous amendments in the legal and administrative process of the EIA. Originality/value: The results obtained from this study were expected to facilitate the evaluation of the EIA process in Turkey and to guide other similar countries. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.", Environmental impact assessment; Environmental impact assessment performance; Environmental law; Environmental regulation; Procedural effectiveness; Turkey,1.0
446,Brine discharge to the puck bay - A real problem for future investments; [Problem zrzutu solanki do zatoki puckiej],"Building of gas storage facilities (underground caverns) in the Kosakowo district by salt body leaching is the second investment of that kind in Poland. However, for the first time brine is to be discharged to the marine environment of the Puck Bay-the area protected within the Natura 2000 network. Over the world, technologies producing brine as a byproduct and its discharge to the water bodies are commonly applied. In regard to marine waters, brine concentration is essential, less than its composition. Procedures preceding the construction of caverns in the Kosakowo district lasted from 1998 to 2008 when the investor finally obtained environmental permit. Selection of the Puck Bay for brine discharge resulted from proximity of salt deposits and from economic reasons, i.e. cost-effectiveness of constructing a pipeline for brine produced in 10 caverns. The main problem of such an investment in marine environment was to meet the requirements of regional authority on not more than 0.5 PSU increase in salt concentration in the close area of discharge outlet (measured over the seabed); a basic salinity amounting 7.5 PSU. This condition should minimize the negative influence of 3.6 million ton of brine discharged during ten-years period into the Puck Bay. During ten years of preparatory works no study was conducted to assess the impact of brine discharge on marine environment, particularly on marine organisms. The only calculations and modeling regarded efficiency of brine diffusion in the water column as it was essential to design diffusers (IBW PAN & Deltares Institute in Netherlands). The studies showed that application of selected technical solutions should enable meeting requirements of regional authorities. The results were incorporated in 2007 Report on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) which states that impact of brine discharge on biocenosis of the Puck Bay will be negligible (Jenczelewski et al, 2007; Kruk-Dowgiallo et ai, 2008), as the discharge should not cause any considerable changes in water salinity in the diffuser vicinity comparing with natural salinity fluctuations of 2 PSU and salinity increase should not exceed 0.5 PSU. The problem with acquiring the environmental permit appeared when effectiveness of diffuser presented in the EIA Report was questioned by a group of ""conservative ecologists"". Consequently, the predicted impact of brine discharge on marine environment was denied. The predicted vision of ""ecological catastrophe"" was not, however, supported by any scientific evidence. Conclusions of the 2007 EIA were confirmed in the supplementary 2008 EIA and proved that the location of the installation and the method of the discharge of brine to the marine environment is optimal and it can be regarded environmentally sound in context of the nature protection of the Puck Bay. It showed that no brine, but the outflow from the Dȩbogórze sewage treatment plant will be the main factor negatively affecting the environment of the area. The case study of the gas storage caverns in Kosakowo preparation process shows that a number of arguments used in the interim discussion lacked professional background. Nevertheless they hindered the procedures and led to the situation that previously performed calculations and modeling had to be repeated; and ultimately gave identical results. Spending that time and money on studies on the impact of the brine on the marine biocenoces would be, beyond any doubt, much more beneficial to the environment.", ,1.0
447,Information in an EIA process and the influence thereof on public opinion,"Environmental issues can only be solved by coherent action at local, national and international levels, therefore understanding of the factors that influence the information exchange process is very important. The subject of investigation in this research is the influence of environmental information provided in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process on the level of knowledge concerning environmental issues in the local community. A survey of public opinion of the environmental impacts of the Port of Koper in Slovenia was performed. Results show that respondents did not find the EIA presentations effective and received more information from TV, newspapers and radio. The EIA process did not fulfil its' potential, since respondents express the highest trust in expert information, but the effectiveness of the expert part of the presentation is considered to be low, not reaching the media. By improving the presentations effectiveness in the EIA process, further efforts in informing public and employees could theoretically bring the opinions of both groups to a similar level of understanding. © Imperial College Press.", Environmental impact assessment; Environmental perception; Public participation; Sustainable development,1.0
448,Decentralized wastewater treatment systems: Efficiency and its estimated impact against onsite natural water pollution status. A Romanian case study,"The paper proposes discussions of some concrete datasets resulted for three solutions of wastewaters management systems applied in case of a Romanian petroleum chemical company. These management options, differing especially in type (centralized or decentralized system) and wastewaters treatment system, were emphasized, mainly by real datasets on treatment performance, polluting species removals, risk of some residuals in treated effluents and natural watercourse nearby, but also environmental impact assessment, using the alternative methodology of global pollution index (I*GP). Interpreting datasets based on in-time analyzed physical-chemical quality indicators and river characteristics, it was estimated the standard quality classification of receiving watercourse as ‘medium’ (water quality indices, WQI = 55.58 − 67.47), affected more or less by treated effluents discharged in it. The environmental risks of some selected residuals in treated effluents and natural aquatic receptor were assessed by the risk quotient (RQ) which appreciated the risk of residuals toward aquatic life as no to low-medium level, with few exceptions. The impact assessment results conclude an admissible pollution status of natural water receptor due to company wastewaters mechanical–chemical–biological treatment plant activities, in decentralized (I*GP = 1.73) and centralized (I*GP = 1.83) system, but generating discomfort effects to aquatic life due to only mechanical–chemical treatment plant operating in decentralized system (I*GP = 2.205). Direct discharge of un-treated industrial wastewaters had been interdicted. These real results underline that decentralized systems are reliable, qualitatively efficient and costly effective, offering long-term solution, and that all wastewaters management strategies of petroleum chemical company had been adapted to specific on-site functioning situations. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers", Estimated impact and risk; Global pollution index; Onsite decentralized treatment system; Petroleum chemical company; Risk quotient; Standard water quality indices,1.0
449,Social return on investment as a tool for environmental impact and strategic assessments: Evidence from South Korea,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a critical tool for evaluating the potential environmental impacts of development projects. While much research has explored EIA's methodologies, there has been limited focus on the quantification of its environmental benefits relative to the cost of development. Prior research on performance metrics in ECBA has focused on either environmental or financial aspect alone. To address this gap, this study evaluates the effectiveness of EIA programs in South Korea by calculating their Social Return on Investment (SROI). Our analysis shows that EIA of a steam power project yielded a 12 % annual social return from invested capital by reducing air pollution, while a golf course development EIA provided a 1 % annual social return through land protection. This shows that using SROI helps identify projects that offer the greatest environmental benefits for the investment, enabling governments to allocate constrained funds more effectively toward projects that maximize environmental sustainability. The integration of SROI into EIA and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) further provides policymakers with a unified metric for comparing policy alternatives and facilitates communication among stakeholders by integrating environmental and financial effectiveness into a single performance measure. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.", Environment impact assessment; Investment project; Social return on investment; South Korea; Strategic environmental assessment,1.0

This paper assesses the capacity of the MS·3 soil microcosm as a tool for targeting the environmental impact assessment of veterinary drugs, using ivermectin as model. Two screening MS·3 were performed using different European soils; one with a soil collected in an agricultural station near to Madrid, Spain and a second with a soil collected in a farm area close to York, UK. Soils were fortified with ivermectin at the following ranges: 0.01-10 mg kg-1 and 0.1-100 mg kg-1 in the Madrid and York studies, respectively. The effects on earthworms, plants and soil microorganisms were assessed in the Madrid soil. Toxicity tests on aquatic organisms (algae, cladocerans and in vitro fish cell line RTLW1) were also conducted with the leachates. No effects were observed in earthworms and plants at any tested concentration; reduction in the respiration rate (< 5%) of soil microorganisms was detected. Earthworm/soil bioconcentration factors decreased with the increase in soil concentrations and were higher for the York soil. Effects on daphnids were observed in tested leachates; based on measured levels of ivermectin in the leachates an EC50 of about 0.5 μgL-1 can be estimated. Comparisons based on toxicity data and equilibrium partitioning confirmed that the main risk is expected to be related to the high sensitivity of cladocerans. The results confirm that MS·3 systems are cost-effective tools for assessing the impact of veterinary pharmaceuticals when applied to agricultural land, as previously demonstrated for antimicrobials.", Effects; Higher tier ecotoxicity test; Ivermectin; Soil microcosm; Veterinary medicines,0.0
452,Bird sensitivity to disturbance as an indicator of forest patch conditions: An issue in environmental assessments,"An Environmental Assessment (EA) is one of the steps within the Environmental Impact Assessment process. Birds are often used in EA to help decision makers evaluate potential human impacts from proposed development activities. A ""sensitivity to human disturbance"" index, created by Parker III et al. (1996) for all Neotropical species, is commonly considered an ecological indicator. However, this parameter was created subjectively and, for most species, there have been no rigorous field test to validate its effectiveness as such. Therefore, in this study, we aim to: (1) evaluate if, at the local scale, birds from forest patches in a human-modified landscape (HML) may differ in sensitivity from Parker's sensitivity classification; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the species richness value at each sensitivity level as an ecological indicator; (3) gather information on how often and in which manner Parker's classification has been used in EA. To do so, bird sampling was performed in eight forest patches in a HML over one year. Then, we created a local sensitivity to disturbance using information about threat, endemism, spatial distribution and relative abundance of all species in the study area. We found that 37% of the forest birds showed different local sensitivity levels when compared with Parker's classification. Our results show that only the richness of high-sensitivity species from our local classification fitted the ecological indicator assumptions helping the environmental conditions evaluation of the studied patches. We conclude that species richness of each Parker's bird sensitivity levels do not necessarily perform as an ecological indicator at the local scale, and particularly in HML. Nevertheless, Parker's Neotropical bird sensitivity classification was used in 50% of EA we reviewed. In these, 76% assumed that it was an accurate ecological indicator of the local forest conditions for birds. The lack of clear criteria used in Parker's classification allows diverse interpretations by ornithologists, and there is no agreement about the ecological meaning of each sensitivity level and what environmental conditions each level may indicate of. Therefore, the use of Parker's classification in EA may jeopardize accurate interpretations of proposed anthropogenic impacts. Furthermore, because a bird species' sensitivity often varies between locations, we argue that Parker's generalized classification of bird sensitivity should not be used as an indicator of forest environmental conditions in EA throughout HMLs in Neotropics. Rather, local bird ecological indices should be explored, otherwise, erroneous predictions of the anthropogenic impacts will continue to be common.", Agricultural landscapes; Atlantic Forest fragments; Bioindicator; Bird conservation; Ecological indicator; Environmental conditions; Environmental impact assessment; Neotropics; Ornithological analysis,1.0
453,Multi-criteria decision-making on assessment of proposed tidal barrage schemes in terms of environmental impacts,"For tidal range power plants to be sustainable, the environmental impacts caused by the implement of various tidal barrage schemes must be assessed before construction. However, several problems exist in the current researches: firstly, evaluation criteria of the tidal barrage schemes environmental impact assessment (EIA) are not adequate; secondly, uncertainty of criteria information fails to be processed properly; thirdly, correlation among criteria is unreasonably measured. Hence the contributions of this paper are as follows: firstly, an evaluation criteria system is established from three dimensions of hydrodynamic, biological and morphological aspects. Secondly, cloud model is applied to describe the uncertainty of criteria information. Thirdly, Choquet integral with respect to λ-fuzzy measure is introduced to measure the correlation among criteria. On the above bases, a multi-criteria decision-making decision framework for tidal barrage scheme EIA is established to select the optimal scheme. Finally, a case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd", Choquet integral; Cloud model; Environmental impact assessment; Fuzzy measure; Multi-criteria decision-making; Tidal barrage,1.0
454,Methods and procedures for environmental risk assessment,"This work presents the state of the art of qualitative and quantitative risk assessment methodologies in a variety of fields. Because risk exists in all ranges of human activity, both private and professional, risk assessment is an attempt to analyze precipitating causes of risk in order to more efficiently reduce its probability and effects. Numerous methodological guidelines within the field of environmental science exist to provide guidance for a risk assessment program, although the level of verifiable quantitative data, such as specific chemical effects and scientifically proven hazards, make a direct transfer of methodologies impossible. The risk-assessments and their key principles detailed within can be also used to assist in the development of decision making process. The common notion of risk is associated with actions or decisions that may have undesired to outcome. This implies that the risk-based approaches focus on the negative impacts and their prevention. Risk assessment places the emphasis on the potential negative environmental impacts of an organization’s activities and allows the identification of indicators that directly reflect its efforts, efficiency and effectiveness in reducing or even preventing them. Risk assessment is one of the steps of the general risk management procedure. Risk management is a technique used to identify, characterize, quantify, evaluate and reduce losses from actions or decisions that may have undesired outcomes. The first step of the generic procedure involves the risk identification that is the systematic identification of all potential actions or decisions with undesired consequences that may result from the operation of an organization. The next step involves the risk assessment, while further steps address issues like the evaluation of risks in order to determine the organizations ability or willingness to tolerate their consequences in view of the associated benefits, and the selection and implementation of the most preferable approach for the reduction of unacceptable risks. Lately, the trend is to integrate the risk principle into impact assessment procedure, and reasons for that are: risk assessment (RA) provides a structured framework for dealing with uncertainty in the assessment of impacts being the subject of debates and concerns, especially, concerning impacts on public health; environmental risk assessment (ERA) is specifically developed to address health issues and contains elaborate techniques for enhancing health impacts assessment comprehension in environmental impact assessment (EIA); ERA emphasizes scientific quantitative approaches and techniques in impact identification and evaluation and for improving the technical background for decision-making; closer cooperation between the environmental impact assessors and risk assessors and creation the mixed expert team would allow for more effective information collecting into environmental assessment process; ERA can be applied not only at the stage of impact prediction and evaluation, but also during project implementation and post-closure stages (over the whole project life cycle). © 2007, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

455,What should be the 'cultural resources' element of an EIA?,"Environmental impact assessments in the United States usually contain an element dealing with impacts on 'cultural resources.' This element is often very limited, addressing only archeological sites or historic buildings, and often addressing even these only by deferring attention to them until after key project decisions have been made. A number of US laws, and good practice, demand a broader and more effective approach. Such an approach is outlined here, following the organization of a typical chapter in a popular university environmental impact assessment textbook.

456,"Social impacts of earthquakes caused by gas extraction in the Province of Groningen, The Netherlands","Gas extraction from the Groningen gasfield in the northern Netherlands has led to localised earthquakes which are projected to become more severe. The social impacts experienced by local residents include: damage to property; declining house prices; concerns about the chance of dykes breaking; feelings of anxiety and insecurity; health issues; and anger. These social and emotional impacts are exacerbated by the increasing distrust Groningen people have towards the national government and the gas company, NAM, a partnership between Shell and ExxonMobil. The earthquakes have reopened discussions about the distribution of benefits from gas production and the extent to which benefits are retained locally. Mitigation of the impacts is attempted, but the lack of trust decreases the effectiveness of the mitigation measures. The extent of this experience of previously-unforeseen, unanticipated impacts suggests that a new social and environmental impact assessment needs to be undertaken, and a new Social Impact Management Plan (SIMP) and Impacts and Benefits Agreement (IBA) developed, so that the project can regain its legitimacy and social licence to operate. In addition to conventional gas, this paper has wider relevance for unconventional gas developments, for example shale gas extraction by hydraulic fracturing methods (fracking). © 2014 Elsevier Inc.", Gas drilling; Impact mitigation; Induced seismicity; Social impact assessment; Social license to operate; Tremors,1.0
457,Benefits and drawbacks of EIA decentralisation in Pakistan,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) was decentralised in Pakistan in 2010. The literature mentions compromised EIA effectiveness in the country, but no previous study tried to investigate how decentralisation of environmental governance has influenced EIA effectiveness. This study is the first of its kind which explores the opinions of key EIA stakeholders regarding the benefits and drawbacks of EIA decentralisation. Thirty-seven semi-structured interviews were conducted with officials from environmental protection agencies (EPAs), Ministry of Climate Change (MoCC) and former Ministry of Environment officials and EIA consultants. Interview data was categorised into themes related to pros and cons of decentralisation. The biggest benefit offered by decentralisation to the EPAs was to make their own customised EIA laws and regulations. However, to date, four EPAs have somewhat modified the 1997 Pakistan Environmental Protection Act and two have updated the 2000 Initial Environmental Examination/EIA regulations. Limited coordination between EPAs and MoCC, political influence and lack of accountability of EPAs were highlighted as the drawbacks of decentralisation. Some EPA officials, however, mentioned that the environmental condition of their areas has improved due to the autonomy of EPAs. Decentralisation is a good idea if provinces use their right to legislate effectively and some sort of accountability mechanisms for EPAs are introduced. The study holds significance because it fills an important knowledge gap. The experience of key EIA stakeholders from the entire country regarding a decentralised EIA system provides insight not just for Pakistan but to policymakers worldwide who may want to decentralise or recentralise EIA in their countries. Future studies may be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of EIA legislation updated by some EPAs. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.", Benefits; Decentralisation; Drawbacks; Effectiveness; EIA,1.0
458,"Ecology, environmental impact statements, and ecological risk assessment: A brief historical perspective","Ecological risk assessment will continue to increase in importance as a conceptual and methodological basis for evaluating environmental impacts as required by the National Environmental Policy Act. Understanding the historical strengths and limitations of more traditional environmental assessments performed in support of the NEPA can facilitate the effective incorporation of ecological risk assessment into the NEPA process. Such integration will also benefit from a knowledge of the historical and continuing development of the ecological risk assessment process, as well as from a recognition of the contributions from modern quantitative ecology and ecosystem science. Adopting a risk-based approach can improve the NEPA process by providing a framework for consistent and comprehensive ecological assessment and by providing a conceptual and methodological basis for addressing the varied uncertainties attendant to environmental assessments. The primary concern in integrating ecological risk assessment into the NEPA process is that ecological risk assessment not merely become a new name for traditional environmental impact assessments. While the integration of ecological risk assessment into the NEPA process occurs, it is important to begin to outline the next transition in environmental assessment capabilities. Operationally linking ecological risk assessment methods with formal decision models appears as a worthwhile objective in beginning this transition. © 1998 by ASP.", Risk-based decision making; Risk-based environmental assessments; Uncertainty in ecological assessments,1.0
459,Species surrogacy in environmental impact assessment and monitoring: Extending the BestAgg approach to asymmetrical designs,"The mainstream approach to define effective surrogates for species in routine biomonitoring focuses on the use of coarse levels of taxonomic resolution. A new approach to species surrogacy, the Best Practicable Aggregation of Species (BestAgg), which uses pilot data to generate null models of decreasing information at increasing levels of aggregation of variables, has been recently proposed. The approach has been tested in different environmental contexts, providing several advantages compared to the analysis at taxonomic levels higher than species. However, BestAgg still lacks a framework for its application to asymmetrical designs, thus limiting its general use in environmental impact assessment. Here, we implemented a new procedure to fill this gap and provided a specific R code for BestAgg in asymmetrical analysis. We presented an example of the application of this procedure to a real case study assessing the potential impact of harbour activities on subtidal sessile assemblages. Results from taxonomically fine-resolved data showed a significant effect of harbour activity on assemblage structure, although variable in time. Such patterns were consistent up to order level. Results based on surrogates from BestAgg were also aligned with those obtained at fine taxonomic resolution, but led to retention of much more information on original patterns and increased timesaving in sample processing compared to a classic approach based on the use of higher taxonomic levels. BestAgg represents a more formal procedure to species surrogacy than the empirical determination of the sufficient taxonomic resolution. The approach increases cost-efficiency while maximizing ecological information, and can be used under a wide range of experimental settings, now including asymmetrical designs. © 2016 Inter-Research.", Asymmetrical designs; Harbour impact; Null models; Sessile assemblages; Species surrogacy; Taxonomic surrogates,1.0
460,Environmental impact assessment: a review,"The review is divided into two main sections. The first section contains a survey of the growth in the use of EIA during the 1970s in Western industrialized economies, Third World countries and international agencies. It highlights a number of key issues associated with these developments-notably the types and numbers of actions which should be submitted to EIA, and the quality of EIA studies and the time and cost incurred in their preparation-and recommends that the focus of future development should be directed towards a more cost-effective 'tiered' system of environmental impact assessment. The second section contains a review of the technical methods which are used in the preparation and publication of EIA studies. These are grouped according to the kind of task they perform in the EIA process: identification, data assembly, prediction, evaluation and communication. This review concludes with recommendations for improvement in the EIA methods in use in such areas as: clearer identification of 'best existing practice', publication of technical guidance based on best practice, provision of training facilities in the use of EIA methods, and re-examination of priorities in environmental monitoring and research. © 1983.", ,1.0
461,Environmental impact assessment framework by integrating scientific analysis and subjective perception,"Environmental impact assessment is widely recognized as an effective tool for supporting the sustainable development of the environment through policy, plan and program decision-making processes. Traditional approach of environmental impact assessment generally focuses on scientific analysis and neglects subjective utilities on the project development. This paper proposes a framework of environmental impact assessment process by integrating subjective perception and scientific analysis. This framework suggests that environmental impacts and their consequent effects are analyzed and calculated based on the inventory analysis, but the non-market loss arising from the construction of the sensitive facility is estimated by contingent valuation method and the relative importance of affecting groups in affecting the ongoing of project development is evaluated by analytical hierarchy process. Eventually, a mathematical model is presented to determine the optimal compensation amount under a targeted refusal rate. Also, a case example is presented to illustrate this approach that integrates the objectively scientific assessment for potentially environmental impacts and individual subjective perception on the non-market value of environmental damages arising from the project development. © IRSEN, CEERS, IAU.", Analytical hierarchy process; Contingent valuation method; Environmental impact assessment; Logit model,1.0

This study examines the effectiveness of Tanzania EIA laws and related practice on the protection of Outstanding Universal Value (OUV) of the world heritage sites during implementation of development projects. The study used data obtained from government officials, policies, laws and reports; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and World Heritage Committee reports; and scholarly works. The study demonstrates that Tanzania EIA laws are inadequate to ensure effective protection of OUV of world heritage sites against harms caused by development projects. The laws do not guarantee effective and broader participation of stakeholders and inclusion of heritage impact assessment in EIA study. The study, therefore, recommends for reform of EIA laws and institutions responsible for supervising EIA. © The Author(s) 2022.", effectiveness; environmental impact assessment; laws in practice; Tanzania; world heritage sites,1.0
463,"Empowering systems analysis for solid waste management: Challenges, trends, and perspectives","Solid waste management is a significant issue for sustainable development that involves the technical, socioeconomic, legal, ecological, political, and even cultural components. For this reason, systems analysis has been uniquely providing interdisciplinary support for policy analysis and decision making in solid waste management for the last few decades. Considering these challenges and accomplishments retrospectively, this paper presents a thorough literature review and in-depth discussions of systems analysis models that are promising for providing forward-looking, cost-effective, risk-informed, and environmentally benign decisions for sustainable solid waste management. To simplify the discussion, the spectrum of these systems analysis models was divided into three broadly based domains associated with fourteen categories, although some of them may be intertwined with each other. The first domain comprises systems engineering models including cost-benefit analysis, forecasting analysis, simulation analysis, optimization analysis, and integrated modeling system; the second domain introduces systems analysis platforms, such as management information systems/decision support systems/expert systems; and the third domain introduces system assessment tools including scenario development, material flow analysis, life-cycle assessment, risk assessment, environmental impact assessment, strategic environmental assessment, socioeconomic assessment, and sustainable assessment. While some models or tools may be elucidated with respect to multiple managerial purposes, such as integrated modeling system and sustainable assessment, others may cover extended foci of market-based instruments and regulatory requirements, such as socioeconomic assessment and environmental impact assessment. The authors use the term systems analysis as a placeholder for the disparate strands of research and practice at this intersection between environmental systems engineering and sustainability science. Given that the sustainable management is necessary at all phases of impact from the interactions among several prescribed paradigms, current and future solid waste management strategies in relation to systems analysis were particularly discussed. Such a critical review paper may aid the prediction of the possible challenges and the preparation of the appropriate tactics in dealing with large-scale complex solid waste management systems under normal operation and special conditions. It should lead the authors to echo some of their real world observational evidence in terms of cost-benefit-risk trade-off in decision analysis for solid waste management. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", simulation and modeling; solid waste management; sustainable management; systems analysis,1.0

And two dimensions should be involved in the analysis process according to the concept of coordination, namely the plan interactivity and plan consistency. A measurable index system is set up to evaluate the level of planning coordination via Delphi approach together with the theoretical study mentioned above. Finally, a case which applies this framework to conducting a planning coordination analysis in the practice of planning environmental impact assessment further demonstrates that the analysis of planning coordination serves not only as an assessment tool, but also an effective mechanism to stress the conflicts among correlative decision-makings.", Planning coordination; Planning environmental impact assessment; Working framework,1.0

Based on several criteria including legal requirements, environmental monitoring/reporting, hazardous/toxic waste management, best practices in environmental management, complaints management, compliance to environmental quality standards, community relation and corporate social responsibility policy, the effectiveness of the ‘AKOBEN Programme’ as a wholly Ghanaian tool for promoting good environmental stewardship was assessed. An adapted version of the integrated policy analysis, which links actual programme performance with criteria for programme performance consisting of an ‘AKOBEN Programme’ commitment review, an ‘AKOBEN Programme’ strategy scan and an ‘AKOBEN Programme’ plan and strategy mix matrix were used in scrutinizing environmental commitments mandated by the ‘AKOBEN Programme’. Even though the ‘AKOBEN Programme’ does not have specific legislations it relies on legal frameworks ‘Environmental Protection Agency Act 1994 (Act 490)’ and Environmental Assessment Regulation 1999, Legislative Instrument 1652. The effect of the ‘AKOBEN Programme’ with reference to air/water quality monitoring, ‘complaints management/community relations and corporate social responsibility’ are moderately positive (++M), highly positive (+++H) and moderately positive (++M) respectively.

466,Designing a graph-based approach to landscape ecological assessment of linear infrastructures,"The development of major linear infrastructures contributes to landscape fragmentation and impacts natural habitats and biodiversity in various ways. To anticipate and minimize such impacts, landscape planning needs to be capable of effective strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and of supporting environmental impact assessment (EIA) decisions. To this end, species distribution models (SDMs) are an effective way of making predictive maps of the presence of a given species. In this paper, we propose to combine SDMs and graph-based representation of landscape networks to integrate the potential long-distance effect of infrastructures on species distribution. A diachronic approach, comparing distribution before and after the linear infrastructure is constructed, leads to the design of a species distribution assessment (SDA), taking into account population isolation. The SDA makes it possible (1) to estimate the local variation in probability of presence and (2) to characterize the impact of the infrastructure in terms of global variation in presence and of distance of disturbance. The method is illustrated by assessing the impact of the construction of a high-speed railway line on the distribution of several virtual species in Franche-Comté (France). The study shows the capacity of the SDA to characterize the impact of a linear infrastructure either as a research concern or as a spatial planning challenge. SDAs could be helpful in deciding among several scenarios for linear infrastructure routes or for the location of mitigation measures. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.", Environmental impact assessment; Fragmentation; Graph theory; Linear infrastructure; Species distribution model,1.0
467,Research on the Vibration Environmental Impact Assessment of Intercity Railway Underground Lines in Metropolitan Areas; [都市圈城际铁路地下线振动环境影响评价研究],"Intercity railways connected to the central areas of cities with underground lines has become a development trend to reduce the fragmentation of urban planning and ease the environmental impact on urban concentrated residential areas. Accurately assessing the environmental impact of vibration and scientifically proposing effective vibration mitigation measures are major issues in the environmental impact assessment of the underground intercity railway project. Through researches on vibration impact characteristics, evaluation system, implementation standards, vibration source intensity and vibration protection measures of the intercity railway underground line in the metropolitan area, it is concluded that it is feasible to construct the 160 km/h intercity railway underground line with reference to the prediction methods and evaluation standards specified in the “Technical Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment of Urban Rail Transit”; based on the actual measurement value verification, the predicted value of environmental vibration is 2. 5 ~ 6. 2 dB larger than the actual measurement value; vibration sources of intercity railways should be obtained through actual measurements, and the comparability with analogous projects should be demonstrated in detail; vibration source control should be prioritized, and comprehensive measures should be taken to reduce the impact of vibration. © 2023 Editorial Office of Railway Standard Design.

468,"Life cycle carbon emission assessment and carbon payback period analysis for the regeneration of old residential areas in cold regions: Case study in Qingdao, China","Communities urgently need to explore green and low-carbon transformation pathways due to high energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, existing studies lack a comprehensive assessment of carbon emissions and analysis regarding carbon reduction during renovation of old residential areas in cold regions. Therefore, this study employs a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the payback period method to evaluate carbon emissions throughout the life cycle comprehensively. It constructs a carbon-emission calculation model based on LCA, specifically tailored to the retrofitting of old residential areas in cold cities. Additionally, it investigates the effectiveness of three typical retrofit measures undertaken in Qingdao, a region located in the cold A zone, focusing on whole-life-cycle energy savings and carbon reduction. The findings reveal that the average annual carbon emission intensity per unit area for Cases 1, 2, and 3 is 12.59 kg-CO2 e/(m2·a), 27.05 kg-CO2 e/(m2·a), and 23.39 kg-CO2 e/(m2·a), respectively. Their corresponding carbon payback periods were 6.06, 7.23, and 16.00 years, respectively, which could be further shortened through material recycling. The environmental impact assessment of typical retrofitting measures contributes to the promotion of sustainable development. Furthermore, this study offers guidance for establishing an effective assessment system that supports the design of energy-saving retrofits. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd", Carbon emissions; Carbon reduction; Life cycle assessment; Payback period method; The regeneration of old residential areas,0.0
469,Environmental impact assessment application in infrastructural projects in Malawi,"The current increase in the number of development projects in Malawi is leading to loss of natural resources and the general degradation of the environment. Both the Malawi Environmental Management Act of 1996 and the Guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessment of 1997, prescribe a list of infrastructural projects that must undergo environmental impact assessment (EIA) before their implementation. This study identifies the key limitations of EIA application to infrastructural projects in Malawi. A desktop study used to gather information in this study involved a review of several documents such as EIA reports, policies and laws, books, journals and internet articles. Primary data was obtained from policymakers, contractors, EIA practitioners and the general public using both structured and unstructured interviews, as well as through questionnaires. Focus group discussions and direct observations were employed wherever necessary in the study. Major limitations to successful EIA in infrastructural projects in Malawi include: (1) limited experience and practice of EIA practitioners; (2) cost of EIA process; (3) limited links between EIA and urban planning procedures; (4) lack of political will; (5) project delays; (6) lack of effective monitoring and auditing, (7) lack of data, especially those to be used in predictive models. This violates the principles of sustainability science and the international best practices for EIA that were developed by the International Association for Impact Assessment. It is recommended that active environmental management should actively involve the interests of all stakeholders, and that follow up of predicted environmental impacts resulting from any project should entail monitoring, auditing and reporting. © 2010 Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science, United Nations University, and Springer.", Environmental impact assessment; Environmental management; Infrastructural project; Sustainability science,1.0

471,Key evaluation framework for the impacts of urbanization on air environment - A case study,"Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model is one of the most commonly used models for environmental impacts assessment. As an effective tool for strategic management and performance evaluation, Balanced Scorecard (BSC) has been widely applied in the management field. PSR and BSC share the similar principles such as systematic, causality and sustainability oriented. Furthermore, BSC features equilibrium and dynamics. It is a feasible and innovative approach to establish a comprehensive environmental assessment framework by combining BSC and PSR. By placing the customer indicator on the top layer and following the PSR principle on the second layer, one model was designed to examine the impact of urbanization on the air environment in Shandong Province from 2005 to 2009 with factor component analysis. The results showed that urbanization and air environmental sustainability has been an upward trend in Shandong. The sustainable development level is low in Shandong presently, which provides a large potential for further improvement.

The EIA is an example of an effective tool that supports spatial planning in implementing sustainable development. The aim is to present the idea and benefits of a facilitative and collaborative approach in teaching the EIA, stressing the role of student co-operation and involvement, as well as a participatory and interdisciplinary approach. Inspiring controversial case studies present different problems and approaches as examples of best practice. The teaching method underlies the necessity of understanding wider processes leading to environmental threats and the ways to prevent them, crossing different disciplines. Such an approach, attractive to students, can present the EIA not only as a formal procedure, but as a useful tool for environmental protection. Consequently, it may strengthen the student's future activities in implementing the idea of sustainable development in practice. © 2020 WIETE.", ,1.0
474,Sustainability Potentials of Informal Gold Recovery from Discarded Mobile Phones: E-waste Management Insights for Global Business and Trade,"Purpose – Electronic waste, or e-waste, continues to flourish as a result of exponential growth in technology. The large volume of e-waste generated can be a potential source of resource and energy, hence, providing a complementa-ry means to the primary extraction of minerals such as copper and gold in addition to promoting a circular economic model. In the Philippines, informal gold recovery is one of the sinks for such e-waste. Design/Methodology/Approach – This study evaluated the potentials of informal gold recovery from end-of-life cellular phones from the perspective of environmental soundness and socio-economic viability. It aimed to serve as a baseline measurement of the economic benefits of e-waste material recovery to strengthen the need to establish an effective e-waste management framework and tap its potentials as an emerging sector in the economy. Process-based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was conducted using 100g Au with data collected much earlier. The resulting impacts to human health and the environment were determined following the procedure indicated in ReCiPe (2008). Benefit-cost (BC) ratio was also computed as the measure of economic benefit while, for the social impacts, a criticality score was computed. Findings – Results of the environmental impact assessment showed that informal gold recovery poses a large threat to human health due to the emitted gases. This result is verified by the high risk computed in the social impact assessment contributed primarily by the risk of poisoning, risk of acquiring eye injury and respiratory and nervous system diseases from inhalation of fumes. Nevertheless, the risks were lessened with improvements in the system. A benefit-cost ratio of 1.21 was computed, entailing an economic benefit from this practice, with labor cost contributing the highest. Research Implications – Informal gold recovery is potentially sustainable, but to reap the greatest benefits and reduce the risks, some actions or interventions at the operational and national level are needed, such as usage of less hazardous substances, reduction of labor and protection of workers, utilization of methods engineering to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness, formulation and assessment of national e-wastes inventory, and implementation of an e-waste management system policy to harness global business and trade opportunities. © 2020 International Academy of Global Business and Trade.

475,Thermodynamic assessment of an integrated renewable energy multigeneration system including ammonia as hydrogen carrier and phase change material energy storage,"Sustainable development and effective management of resources has become an integral need of future energy systems. This study considers a unique multi-generation system involving ammonia synthesis using electrolytically produced hydrogen from desalinated water, alongside supply of basic utilities like potable water, heating, cooling, and electricity. The integrated system employs a phase change material based-energy storage unit to provide uninterrupted energy supply to the system. Energy and exergy analysis of the overall and sub-systems based on the first and second law of thermodynamics reveal valuable insights into the performance of such a system. A rigorous analysis of external parameters including environmental temperature, direct normal irradiance on the overall and component energy/exergy efficiencies is performed. The analysis reveals that the utilities demand of a remote area can be met in a more sustainable and environmentally friendly manner using the proposed multi-generation system. An overall system exergy and energy efficiencies of 18.9% and 28.0% respectively are obtained, whereas the sub-systems are also found to have energy efficiencies ranging between 15 and 80%. The highest exergy destruction rates of 25 megawatts and 32 megawatts are observed for the multi-stage flash distillation and the steam Rankine cycle sub-systems respectively. An elementary environmental impact assessment of the same system reveals that the proposed system can help reduce the carbon footprint by almost 60% with no significant compromise on the overall exergy and energy efficiencies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd", Ammonia; Biomass; Desalination; Efficiency; Environment; Exergy; Phase change material; Solar energy; Sustainable,0.0
476,"Developing a carbon footprint model and environmental impact analysis of municipal solid waste transportation: A case study of Tehran, Iran","The greenhouse gas emitted due to transportation is the third greatest emitter globally, and its impact has become a threat to the environment, public health, and economic development. Waste transportation is excluded in studies of waste management despite its significant environmental impacts such as global warming and human toxicity. The objective of this study is to develop a quantification model to estimate the carbon footprint of waste transportation and environmental impact assessments in three categories applied in Tehran using IPCC guidelines. In Tehran, light and heavy vehicles ran on diesel fuel. Data on fuel and waste characteristics were provided by Tehran’s department of transportation and municipality, respectively. In this study, transport-related emissions are 8.47 k tonCO2eq/y, and the carbon footprint of waste transportation is 93.57 g of CO2 eq per ton of waste transported (t.km), which is relevant to three main parameters: the amount of waste transported annually, the freight shipped from the temporary station to the disposal landfill site, and fossil fuels consumed. Also, an environmental impact assessment in three categories–human health (global warming, abiotic depletion, and ozone layer depletion), resources (fossil fuels), and ecosystem quality (acidification and eutrophication)–using SimaPro, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool is presented. Global warming (3.49 kg CO2 eq/t MSW), human toxicity (0.95 kg 1,4-DB eq/t MSW), and freshwater aquatic eco-toxicity (0.04 kg 1,4-DB eq/t MSW) have the greatest impact among categories. Sensitivity analysis of the effective parameters allows us to conclude one of the potential implications of this study would be the introduction of natural gas or biogas-based trucks replacing diesel fuel vehicles to improve air quality and mitigate the greenhouse gas emission. Implications: This paper addresses the significant issue of global warming, particularly in Iran, a developing country that ranks among the top contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. The study emphasizes the importance of evaluating emissions across various sectors such as electricity, waste, etc., Specifically, in this paper we focus on developing a model to quantify the environmental impact resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles, focus on the metropolitan city of Tehran as a case study. By examining the waste transportation process, we aim to provide decision-makers with effective strategies to mitigate the environmental consequences. In this paper, we develop a simple quantification term of Carbon Footprint to calculate total greenhouse gas emission of waste transportation process. Carbon Footprint is a fraction which, its numerator is total greenhouse gas emission and its denominator is total waste transported in traveled distance. Effective parameters have been investigated and based on parameters and emission factors taken out of IPPC, the carbon footprint model have been developed. The total greenhouse gas emission of this study and the carbon footprint has estimated at 8.47 k tonCO2eq/y and 93.57 g CO2eq/t.km respectively. Furthermore, the paper explores additional environmental impacts beyond global warming, including abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, photochemical oxidation, and freshwater aquatic eco-toxicity. Using SimaPro software these eight impact categories have been estimated. in this study we identify fossil fuel consumption, traveled distance, and mass transported are the primary parameters influencing greenhouse gas emissions and the carbon footprint. To reduce emissions in the waste transportation system, we suggest promoting renewable biofuels, highlighting Iran as a suitable candidate due to its high percentage of biodegradable material in municipal solid waste. Additionally, the study assesses nonrenewable energy and mineral extraction using the IMPACT 2002+ V2.15/IMPACT 2002+ method, revealing that global warming (100 years), human toxicity (100 years), freshwater aquatic eco-toxicity, nonrenewable energy, and mineral extraction have the most significant impacts on the municipal solid waste transportation system. Overall, this research underscores the need for quantifying environmental impacts and recommends strategies to mitigate them in waste transportation processes, particularly in developing countries like Iran. © 2023 Air & Waste Management Association.", ,0.0
477,Environmental impact assessment of salt harvesting from the salt lakes,"Urmia Saline Lake, USL which is registered as an international park by the United Nations, has suffered hypersalinity and serious dryness in recent years. Increasing the dryness trend has been led to a great tendency, especially by private sectors to harvest salt from different parts of the bed sediments. During this study the four- step process was used for environmental impact assessment of such a large scale salt harvesting activities with specialized Folchi matrix and enriched by data on heavy metal concentrations in the limited number of sediment samples. Impact analysis using matrix showed that the most significant impacts were on environmental components, namely “land use”, “gradient and topography of the lake bed” and “hydrology and lake water quality” with score values of 73.22, 73.21 and 72.45, respectively. The mean concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Ni and Zn in salt and sediment samples were 15.2±8.8, 0.05±0.047, 15±8.2, 0.54±0.3, 11.9±6.28, 15.4±9.56 and 22.3±13.66 mg/kg, respectively. The higher concentration of arsenic and lead in comparison with earth crust averages, warns that dispersion of salt particles from storage piles may affect local people’s health. This study provides readers and authorities with environmental impacts of salt harvesting from unique saline Lake of Iran, presents effective management options such as stopping any unlicensed and unrestrained salt harvesting activities on the USL bed, avoiding deep excavations, minimizing accumulation of piles to prevent the diffusion of salt particles etc. and also specialized the Folchi matrix for application in similar projects. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.", Environmental consequences; Folchi matrix; Heavy metals; Iran; Surface mining,1.0
478,Recent advances in research on LUCC: Based urban ecological security,"Worldwide urbanization occurred since the industrial revolution, and this trend is expected to last in the coming decades. Dramatic land use/cover change (LUCC) driven by urbanization has been the most prominent force in the degradation of the structure and function of the ecosystems, thus undermining the capacity of the ecosystems to sustain the development of human society. Therefore, LUCC driven by urbanization has recently attracted much attention. Locally and globally, combined with the knowledge of socio-economic and biophysical sciences, modelling LUCC and its environmental impacts can be employed as a useful tool to assess the adverse or favourable impacts on the ecosystem functions? which are the key foundation for the sustainability of human society and balance of global ecosystems. So far many efforts have been made to enhance the effectiveness of LUCC models. However; due to the complexity of the interactive systems; it is still difficult to understand; explain; and predict the dynamics and trends of LUCC and its possible ecological consequences. Although there is the close correlation between LUCC and urban ecological security; and the driving forces of land use changes have been well documented; whereas papers of impacts of land use changes on urban ecological security are scarce. Based on the review of published papers on LUCC and urban ecological security (UES); the concept of UES is redefined. Two stages of studies on UES have also been identified-the early qualitative research and the current quantitative research. Furthermore; three aspects worth further studies are emphasized: (1) Due to the incomplete theories of UES; the role of LUCC in the integrated assessment of UES was ignored. Therefore; it's still difficult to use LUCC as the guidance to the urban planning and construction; (2) Methods including information technique; mathematical model; GIS; Environmental impact assessment (EIA); Ecological risk assessment (ERA); and policy analysis were seldom incorporated in the studies of the ecological effects of urban land use. In practice; dynamical simulation and multi-scenarios analysis are expected to serve as the basis for decision-making. Also; the effectiveness of the above integrated methods needs to be assessed to produce the optimized paradigm for the study on urban security; Detection of land use dynamics; mechanism of driving forces; and ecological responses were seldom employed in the comprehensive studies on regional ecological security and ecological control of urbanization. Therefore; such studies have limited practical significance. Finally; future trends of LUCC and urban security studies are discussed: (1) Close linkage of LUCC and accompanied ecological consequences at different levels should be achieved; given the widely adopted LUCC monitoring networks by national and international agencies; (2) Application of integrated methods; including GIS; RS; EIA; ERA; spatial analysis; economic models; metabolism models; etc.; should be developed on the basis of explicit case studies; (3) Based on the theories and principles of interdisciplinary sciences; the detailed and rational frameworks for the evaluation methods and indicator systems should be developed.", Ecological control; Land use/cover change (LUCC); Urban ecological security (UES); Urbanization,1.0
479,High-resolution gridded livestock projection for western China based on machine learning,"Accurate high-resolution gridded livestock distribution data are of great significance for the rational utilization of grassland resources, environmental impact assessment, and the sustain-able development of animal husbandry. Traditional livestock distribution data are collected at the administrative unit level, which does not provide a sufficiently detailed geographical description of livestock distribution. In this study, we proposed a scheme by integrating high-resolution gridded geographic data and livestock statistics through machine learning regression models to spatially disaggregate the livestock statistics data into 1 km × 1 km spatial resolution. Three machine learning models, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and deep neural network (DNN), were constructed to represent the complex nonlinear relationship between various environmental factors (e.g., land use practice, topography, climate, and socioeconomic factors) and livestock density. By applying the proposed method, we generated a set of 1 km × 1 km spatial distribution maps of cattle and sheep for western China from 2000 to 2015 at five-year intervals. Our projected cattle and sheep distribution maps reveal the spatial heterogeneity structures and change trend of livestock distribution at the grid level from 2000 to 2015. Compared with the traditional census livestock density, the gridded livestock distribution based on DNN has the highest accuracy, with the determinant coefficient (R2) of 0.75, root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.82 heads/km2 for cattle, and the R2 of 0.73, RMSE of 31.38 heads/km2 for sheep. The accuracy of the RF is slightly lower than the DNN but higher than the SVM. The projection accuracy of the three machine learning models is superior to those of the published Gridded Livestock of the World (GLW) datasets. Consequently, deep learning has the potential to be an effective tool for high-resolution gridded livestock projection by combining geographic and census data. © 2021 by the authors.

By sorting out the specific clauses in the EIA Law, combined with the relevant requirements of EIA in the safety supervision of nuclear facilities, summarizing the review procedures and supervision requirements of EIA in the safety supervision of nuclear facilities, and using the research method combining analysis and descriptive statistics, the research on the effectiveness of the implementation of EIA Law in the supervision of nuclear facilities was carried out. The research was from three aspects, i.e. the construction of nuclear safety regulations and standards related to EIA Law, the changing trend of nuclear facility emissions under the supervision of EIA Law, and the implementation of ""decentralization, regulation and service"" to optimize EIA procedures. The results showed that, under the guidance of EIA Law, the nuclear facility safety regulation and the standard system had been continuously improved, the effluent and solid waste discharges and productions of nuclear facilities had been continuously optimized, the focus of supervision had become clearer, and the quality of EIA had been continuously improved. At the same time, from the perspectives of the inspection and random inspection mechanism, the implementation of post-evaluation and the specific supervision contents of EIA, the shortcomings of EIA Law in the supervision of nuclear facilities were put forward, with relevant suggestions given. © 2022 The Author(s).", effectiveness; effluent; EIA Law; nuclear facility; nuclear safety supervision,1.0
482,Consideration of climate change on environmental impact assessment in Spain,"Most of the projects subject to environmental impact assessment (EIA) are closely related to climate change, as they contribute to or are affected by it. The growing certainty about climate change and its impacts makes its consideration an essential part of the EIA process, as well as in strategic environmental assessment (SEA).This paper examines how climate change (CC) has been taken into account in EIA in Spain through the analysis of 1713 environmental records of decision (RODs) of projects submitted for EIA. In 2013 Spain approved one of the most advanced laws in terms of CC consideration in environmental assessment, although it had not yet accumulated extensive practice on the issue. This contrasts with the situation of countries like Canada or the USA, which have a significant body of experience without specific legal requirements.Only 14% of the RODs analysed included references to CC, and in more than half of the cases it was a mere citation. Thermal power plants, which are subject to specific GHG regulations, show the highest consideration, while transport infrastructures, which are important contributors to CC, show a very low consideration. Almost all the references are related to their contribution to CC, while consideration of the effects of CC is minimal.The increasingly common incorporation of CC into SEA, should not imply its exclusion from EIA, because both processes have different aims and uses. Including the obligation to consider CC in the EIA regulations is highly desirable, but probably not enough without other measures, such as practical guidance, training and motivational programmes for practitioners and evaluators. But even these actions cannot ensure effective and adequate assessments of CC. Probably more resources should be spent on creating greater awareness in all the agents involved in EIA. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.", Climate change; EIA; Spain,1.0
483,"Biomonitoring of heavy metal contamination with roadside trees from metropolitan area of Hefei, China","Air and dust borne heavy metals can be deposited and bioaccumulated by plants; therefore, biomonitoring employing plants is an effective tool for environmental impact assessment in urban environments. In this study, in addition to road dust, leaves and bark were collected from four common tree species at roadside and urban park sampling sites within the metropolitan area of Hefei, China. A range of heavy metals were analyzed by ICP-MS and AFS. The metal accumulation index (MAI) was adopted to compare the bioaccumulation capacity. Results showed that Cd was highly enriched in road dust although its abundance was low in comparison with that of other elements. The MAI values presented a narrow range (1.8–2.7); however, significant differences (p < 0.05) were found for Al, Cu, Zn, and As among the tree species. Moreover, deciduous Platanus orientalis bioaccumulated more nonessential As than the other species and deserved further risk management. In addition, bark samples from Cinnamomum camphora bioaccumulated more heavy metals than the other species as a result of its morphological and anatomical characteristics. The distribution patterns of heavy metals in tree tissues showed obvious spatial heterogeneity, as impacted by anthropogenic activities to varying degrees. This study examined the biomonitoring potential of roadside trees and the distribution pattern of heavy metals in an urban area under rapid development. Results from the present study could provide baseline data for urban environmental impact assessment and the design of green belts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.", Biomonitoring; Heavy metals; Plant tissues; Road dust; Urban environment,0.0
484,Quantifying the effects of overgrazing on mountainous watershed vegetation dynamics under a changing climate,"Grazing is a major ecosystem disturbance in arid regions that are increasingly threatened by climate change. Understanding the long-term impacts of grazing on rangeland vegetation dynamics in a complex terrain in mountainous regions is important for quantifying dry land ecosystem services for integrated watershed management and climate change adaptation. However, data on the detailed long-term spatial distribution of grazing activities are rare, which prevents trend detection and environmental impact assessments of grazing. This study quantified the impacts of grazing on vegetation dynamics for the period of 1983–2010 in the Upper Heihe River basin, a complex multiple-use watershed in northwestern China. We also examined the relative contributions of grazing and climate to vegetation change using a dynamic grazing pressure method. Spatial grazing patterns and temporal dynamics were mapped at a 1 km × 1 km pixel scale using satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) data. We found that overgrazing was a dominant driver for LAI reduction in alpine grasslands and shrubs, especially for the periods of 1985–1991 and 1997–2004. Although the recent decade-long active grazing management contributed to the improvement of LAI and partially offset the negative effects of increased livestock, overgrazing has posed significant challenges to shrub-grassland ecosystem recovery in the eastern part of the study basin. We conclude that the positive effects of a warming and wetting climate on vegetation could be underestimated if the negative long-term grazing effects are not considered. Findings from the present case study show that assessing long-term climate change impacts on watersheds must include the influences of human activities. Our study provides important guidance for ecological restoration efforts in locating vulnerable areas and designing effective management practices in the study watershed. Such information is essential for natural resource management that aims at meeting multiple demands of watershed ecosystem services in arid and semiarid rangelands. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.", Climate change detection; Grazing pressure; Leaf area index; Mountainous watershed management; Vegetation dynamics,1.0
485,Biodiversity monitoring in the environmental impact assessment of mining projects: a (persistent) waste of time and money?,"Environmental impact assessments, not only in Brazil, but also globally, have long had their effectiveness questioned. Among the most frequently debated problems are: low quality of the impact assessment statements, weak public participation, project delays, increased costs for proponents, amongst others. The ineffectiveness of the environmental impact assessment system is corroborated by recent scholarly articles that argue that poor follow-up is one of the key elements behind the worst environmental disaster in Brazil, the Fundão Dam failure. The quality of monitoring programs has long been criticized in Brazil for being partially implemented and for failing to clearly translate into better environmental decision-making. This paper discusses the state of environmental impact assessment related to biodiversity monitoring programs in Brazil's mining regions, highlighting the political interference around this practice. Biodiversity monitoring programs should set a collection protocol, using a robust sampling design, with sufficient survey effort, spatial replication, methodological consistency and time to detect eventual ecological alterations. Without scientific rigor, collected data may have no value for decision-making, representing a complete waste of time and money. © 2017 Associação Brasileira de Ciência Ecológica e Conservação", Biodiversity; Brazil; Environmental impact assessment; Mining; Monitoring,1.0
486,A framework proposal for scheduling environmental impact evaluation in manufacturing systems,"The environmental performance of scheduling decisions in complex manufacturing systems is influenced by machine deterioration, resource consumption, and dynamic operation states. However, existing approaches often lack comprehensive environmental impact assessments while ensuring adaptability across diverse production environments. This study presents the Scheduling Environmental Impact Evaluation (SEIE) framework, which integrates an object-oriented hierarchical data representation with a simulation-based methodology to assess the Expected Environmental Impact (EEI) scheduling solutions under machine deterioration. Unlike traditional scheduling models, SEIE treats scheduling solutions as inputs rather than generating new ones. The framework is designed for scalability and adaptability, supporting various production systems (e.g. flow shop, job shop) and accommodating different data availability conditions, including real-time monitoring, historical data, and stochastic or deterministic simulations. To demonstrate its applicability, a hypothetical case study evaluates scheduling solutions based on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy consumption while incorporating machine deterioration effects on operation time and energy efficiency. Results confirm SEIE’s effectiveness in modelling complex production systems and structuring environmental impact evaluations. The framework supports structured decision-making for modern scheduling systems’ design and operation by quantifying sustainability impacts and comparing scheduling alternatives. It enables manufacturers to assess environmental implications, refine scheduling strategies, and integrate sustainability considerations into production planning. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.", environmental impact; machine degradation; manufacturing systems; performance evaluation; resource consumption; Scheduling,0.0
487,Life cycle assessment of rainwater harvesting system components – To determine environmentally sustainable design,"There is a common perception that rainwater harvesting (RWH) is an environmentally sustainable water supply option. This perception is not always precise for all arrangements of the RWH system and components. Thus, all potential features of RWH need to be thoroughly studied to verify its environmental impacts. Broadly, on a household-scale RWH, there are two LCA aspects available in the literature, which can be identified as selecting tank material on the one hand and saving potable water on the other hand. Most of these studies used HDPE as tank material and its fabrication, transportation, installation, and disposal. However, the effects of yearly runoff and pollutant load reductions in net environmental impact assessments were not included in those studies. In this study, catchment-scale net environmental impacts of RWH systems made of different tank materials (e.g. HDPE, LDPE, ferrocement, and steel), components (with pump, no pump, and raised tank bases), tank and roof sizes, and varying annual rainfall patterns (e.g. dry, average and wet years) for various RWH supply reliabilities, were quantified through LCA approach. Results show that the HDPE tank has lesser impacts in most of the impact categories than other tanks. RWH systems with tank sizes of 2000 and 3000 L without pumps, and tank size of 2000 L with a pump under 150 m2 roof, are the most feasible environmental perspectives. The water-saving and pollutant load reductions cannot compensate for the pump operation's impacts, except for very few cases, like 2000 L tank during the driest rain year at lower reliabilities. A tank size larger than 2000 L would not be effective. On average, 70% of the total net life cycle impacts were developed from the operational phase of the RWH (with a pump). The pumping operation provided about 6.5 times higher CO2-eq emission than the water-main. The outlined strategy would help select tank materials, sizes, and RWH accessories based on annual rainfall and roof size available and introduce definite engineering standards, government rebates, and guidelines for RWH. This approach of quantifying the environmental impacts will explain further insights into the RWH system and its components. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd", Eutrophication; Global warming; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Rainwater harvesting (RWH); Recycling; Storm water management model (SWMM),0.0
488,Assessing the environmental impacts of informal settlements in vietnam: The case study of the hue citadel unesco world heritage site,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), although necessarily focussing on the negative impacts of projects, plans or policies, can also be a tool for quickly assessing impacts and prioritising environmental actions. Nowhere is this more effective than in the grassroots context of informal settlements. Worldwide, the number of people living in informal settlements is increasing, including in the rapidly urbanising countries of south-east Asia. The informal settlement at Hue Citadel, Vietnam, a UNESCO World Heritage site, grew during the American War in Vietnam in response to displacement and the need for protection from warfare. Temporary accommodation sprung-up behind the historical fortified ramparts and moat and is often the case with informal settlements, once temporarily established it flourished. The informal settlement now comprises hundreds of combined residential and business dwellings. Without adequate access to clean water, waste management or sanitation, coupled with a lack of infrastructure, the Hue informal settlement has impacted upon the surrounding environment. A resettlement plan has now been implemented by the government which will see residents relocated several kilometres away from the Citadel. Using the Citadel as a case study, this paper considers whether formal EIA could be adapted to rapidly assess the environmental impacts of informal settlements. Based upon the outcomes of this adaptive form of EIA, socio-economic surveys and available scientific literature, consideration could be given as to whether the implementation of an environmental improvement plan might allow people to remain living in an area within which they have strong social and cultural capital. © 2020 WIT Press.", Environmental improvement; Hue citadel informal settlement; Rapid EIA; Relocation for conservation; World heritage,1.0
489,Life cycle assessment of torrefied cornstalk pellets combustion heating system,"Biomass combustion for heating is an important method to utilize raw biomass resources, especially stalks with low calorific value. Torrefaction and compression molding are the effective and common pretreatments for biomass upgrading. In this study, the resources, energy consumption and environmental impact of torrefied cornstalk pellets combustion heating system were studied using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. The scope of the LCA includes 5 stages: biomass planting and collection, transportation, plant construction, pretreatment, and combustion heating. The resource consumption assessment showed a total energy output of the life cycle system corresponding to 19.7 GJ (The utilization of by-products was not considered), while the total energy input was 2671.3 MJ/t, and the net energy was 17028.69 MJ/t. The estimated energy input–output ratio was 7.3. The increased value of fuel energy of cornstalk pellets after torrefaction pretreatment was greater than the energy consumption during the same process. The results of energy consumption showed that the maximum energy input was identified as the planting and collection stage (1246.54 MJ/t), among which the top two are the nitrogen fertilizer energy input (56%) and the agricultural machinery fuel consumption (27%). The nitrogen fertilizer input represents 84.17% of the total energy input of fertilizer. The environmental impact assessment showed that the total GWP of the system is −175.806 kg CO2eq, indicating that the whole life cycle of the system can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Acidification and photochemical oxidation potentials become the main factors influencing the ecological footprint of the system. Thus, considering the comprehensive impact of energy consumption and environmental emission, it is feasible to use torrefied cornstalk pellets as fuel for heating. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd", Combustion heating; Cornstalk; Global warming potential; Life cycle assessment; Torrefaction,0.0
490,Investigating the effectiveness of mandatory integration of health impact assessment within environmental impact assessment (EIA): a case study of Thailand,"The effectiveness of the integration of health impact assessment (HIA) and environmental impact assessment (creating an environmental and health impact assessment’ (EHIA) process) is investigated, drawing on an example of a mandatory requirement in the power plant project sector in Thailand. The analytical framework is based on that outlined in by the authors in 2013, focusing on procedural, substantive, transactive and normative effectiveness criteria, and the evaluation served also to critique this framework in practice. Using documentary analysis and interviews, it was found that a sample of EHIAs are partially effective from the four perspectives of effectiveness. The findings suggest that integrating HIA and EIA still has a long way to go to achieve effective practice. Insufficient resources have been allocated to deliver the level of public participation expected in the regulations, or a sufficient standard of EHIA practice and monitoring. The existing analytical framework was found to be inadequate for transactive effectiveness, and a new criterion added: T5–Availability of human resource in EHIA practice. Recommendations are provided to support the practical integration of HIA into EIA practice in Thailand. © 2017 IAIA.", effectiveness; EHIA in Thailand; Health in EIA; HIA; mandatory EHIA; power plant development,1.0
491,Effect of activated persulfate on gas production from food waste anaerobic digestion,"Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an effective way to improve the utilization of food waste (FW). Activated persulfate is a powerful oxidant. This research investigated the effect of activated persulfate on gas production from FW AD. Three activation methods including heating, lighting, and ultrasonication were used. The results showed that the addition of activated persulfate promoted gas production from FW AD. And the main biogas composition were CH4, CO2, and N2. The difference in SO42− concentration further verified the effect of activated methods on producing sulfate free radicals by heating, lighting and ultrasonication from persulfate. The activated persulfate enhanced gas production by improving the organic hydrolysis. Relatively, lighting and ultrasonication were better than heating in persulfate activation. At the same time, the accumulated gas volumes from ultrasonication (587 mL) and lighting (574 mL) were significantly higher than that in heating (478 mL). The environmental impact assessment and economic assessment suggests that the addition of activated persulfate in FW AD is beneficial because of the lower secondary pollution, lower cost and higher additional value. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd", Anaerobic digestion; Food waste; Gas production; Persulfate,0.0
492,The Zygoptera/Anisoptera Ratio (Insecta: Odonata): a New Tool for Habitat Alterations Assessment in Amazonian Streams,"The accumulation of scientific knowledge is far outstripped by the rate of environmental disturbance from human activities in aquatic habitats. This highlights the need to develop effective proxy measures of aquatic biodiversity that can demonstrate changes in communities associated with human activities. We evaluated whether the relative abundance and species richness of Anisoptera and Zygoptera can be used as a tool to measure environmental impacts on Amazonian streams. Adult of Anisoptera and Zygoptera were sampled in 50 Amazonian streams, in the municipality of Paragominas (Pará state), Brazil, using an entomological handnet. The physical features of each stream were evaluated using an index of environmental integrity (HII). We collected a total of 1769 Odonata specimens, representing 97 species (56 were Zygoptera and 41 were Anisoptera). Habitat modification resulted in an inversion in the proportional abundance and species richness of Anisoptera and Zygoptera, where Zygoptera diversity decreased with the loss of habitat integrity, whereas Anisoptera diversity increased with habitat disturbance. A decline of 0.1 in the habitat integrity index score resulted in an increase of approximately 13 individuals and 11 species of Anisoptera, with the exact opposite effect observed for the Zygoptera. In summary, the Odonata proved to be a useful model for the assessment of Amazonian streams, with sites where more than 54% of the Odonata species were Zygoptera being classified as preserved, and those dominated by Anisoptera species (> 59%) being considered degraded. This approach has clear applications for environmental impact assessments, as it reduces the influence of sampling effort and collector experience on assessment outcomes, and does not rely upon specialist knowledge, given that members of the two suborders are easily distinguished from one and other in the field. © 2019, Sociedade Entomológica do Brasil.", Amazon; biomonitoring; damselflies; dragonflies; environmental change; lotic systems,1.0
493,SEA and EIA: uncertain boundaries in Spain,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) of projects and strategic environmental assessment (SEA) of policies, plans and programmes allow environmental aspects to be incorporated into decision-making. The literature and regulations sometimes present SEA and EIA as isolated silos, but in practice there are intermediate approaches. This paper discusses a number of case studies where the application of EIA and SEA is conceptually unclear, although legally appropriate. The application of SEA or EIA depends in practice on the name of the planning document used, rather than its strategic character, with non-strategic SEAs and strategic EIAs due to a mismatch between planning and EA. The gradual transition between SEA and EIA makes it advisable to establish similar administrative procedures, as well as a common screening stage to determine not only whether or not the proposal should be subject to EA, but also the most appropriate approach. More than one EA process may be necessary throughout the planning cycle, requiring effective tiering. The regulations should define what is considered strategic, and regulate the tiering between SEA and EIA processes. © 2023 IAIA.", environmental assessment tiering; Environmental impact assessment; strategic decisions; strategic environmental assessment,1.0
494,Estimating traffic volume on Wyoming low volume roads using linear and logistic regression methods,"Traffic volume is an important parameter in most transportation planning applications. Low volume roads make up about 69% of road miles in the United States. Estimating traffic on the low volume roads is a cost-effective alternative to taking traffic counts. This is because traditional traffic counts are expensive and impractical for low priority roads. The purpose of this paper is to present the development of two alternative means of cost-effectively estimating traffic volumes for low volume roads in Wyoming and to make recommendations for their implementation. The study methodology involves reviewing existing studies, identifying data sources, and carrying out the model development. The utility of the models developed were then verified by comparing actual traffic volumes to those predicted by the model. The study resulted in two regression models that are inexpensive and easy to implement. The first regression model was a linear regression model that utilized pavement type, access to highways, predominant land use types, and population to estimate traffic volume. In verifying the model, an R2 value of 0.64 and a root mean square error of 73.4% were obtained. The second model was a logistic regression model that identified the level of traffic on roads using five thresholds or levels. The logistic regression model was verified by estimating traffic volume thresholds and determining the percentage of roads that were accurately classified as belonging to the given thresholds. For the five thresholds, the percentage of roads classified correctly ranged from 79% to 88%. In conclusion, the verification of the models indicated both model types to be useful for accurate and cost-effective estimation of traffic volumes for low volume Wyoming roads. The models developed were recommended for use in traffic volume estimations for low volume roads in pavement management and environmental impact assessment studies. © 2016 The Authors", Low volume road; Regression analysis; Traffic volume estimation; Transportation planning; Wyoming county roads,0.0
495,EIA screening in Denmark: A new regulatory instrument?,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is the process by which the effects that proposed projects are likely to have are assessed with respect to a number of environmental criteria. Screening is an activity carried out in advance of an EIA to determine whether, in fact, it is necessary to undertake a full assessment. In that sense screening has become not only an administrative filtering procedure but also effectively a kind of regulation. Since the implementation of the Directive in 1999, counties (county councils) in Denmark have screened around 2000 projects annually. Approximately 3 percent of the decisions arising from screening lead to a ""full EIA"". This article is based on a study of 98 documented screening decisions combined with interviews with developers and their consultants as well as county officials for each project. Herein, we analyse both the number of modifications to projects made due to the screening process and also how radical or significant the modifications were. EIA regulation meant that approximately 45 percent of the projects were modified. Around half of these modifications were actually made before the administrative process even started. The mere fact that screening exists functions as an eye-opener to developers and consultants. In general, the nature of changes made before and after submission of the application was similar. They covered basically minor changes. Examining the assessments made during screening more closely, we conclude that there is still far to go in order to make the assessment broader and more holistic in accordance with the ambitions set out in the EIA Directive. Among other things, this goes for the assessment of cumulative and potential impacts. On the basis of the evaluation, we also conclude that screening is effectively a regulatory instrument in its own right. Moreover, it seems to be a cost-effective instrument in the sense that, without incurring much administrative expense, it potentially results in environmental benefits. © 2005 Imperial College Press.", Effects of regulatory instruments; EIA; Implementation; Regulatory instruments; Scoping; Screening,1.0
496,Use of numerical models to determine the effectiveness of anti-vibration systems for railways,"Vibration from trains can cause annoyance and also concern about possible damage to property. It is a major issue in the environmental impact assessment of new railways and where new traffic is to be added on existing railways. Track designed to control vibration has been implemented on a number of railways. These designs are effective for vibration at frequencies at the low end of the audible range. Such vibration causes re-radiated noise in buildings and is especially associated with trains in tunnels. However, at present there are no proven, effective solutions for vibration from heavy freight trains. This occurs at lower frequencies (down to about 4 Hz) and can be felt. In an attempt to deal with low-frequency vibration, experimental track has been built containing continuous slabs of concrete. This has shown encouraging results in tests but it is not clear how generally applicable these improvements would be, or even whether the test results were valid. To clarify these matters it is necessary to develop theoretical models. To date, a number of two- and three-dimensional models have been developed at British Rail Research. These are used to investigate the expected performance of different track constructions covering the cases of both re-radiated noise and low-frequency vibration. Experimental work is being carried out in parallel to validate the theoretical approach and to provide data on appropriate material parameters for the ground.", ,1.0
497,Stakeholders in the EIA Process: What is Important for them? the Case of Road Construction,"Public participation is one of the conditions for an effective environmental impact assessment. Quite often public participation is limited to the general public but various organizations, governmental and non-governmental institutions, business enterprises are left aside. The paper analyses the attitudes of different enterprises/organizations with focus on a road construction (Siaurine Street) case in Vilnius, Lithuania in regard to the environmental impact assessment process. The survey indicated that only a very small part of respondents from different enterprises and organizations has been approached in particular environmental impact assessment process, although the construction project was relevant for nearly half of all surveyed enterprises. Companies, located in the territory of the planned Siaurine Street, highlighted that the major significant components of environmental aspects are noise and air pollution, between socio-economic environment-suitable infrastructure, human well-being and business and job opportunities. The type of company's activity, income, number of employees and their distance to the Siaurine Street were the main factors determining respondent choices. © 2018 Renata Dagiliute and Gintare Juozapaitiene.", Environmental impact assessment; Participation; Road construction; Socio-economic environment; Stakeholders,1.0
498,Modeling exposure of mammalian predators to anticoagulant rodenticides,"Anticoagulant rodenticides (AR) are a widespread and effective method of rodent control but there is concern about the impact these may have on non-target organisms, in particular secondary poisoning of rodent predators. Incidence and concentration of AR in free-living predators in Denmark is very high. We postulate that this is caused by widespread exposure due to widespread use of AR in Denmark in and around buildings. To investigate this theory a spatio-temporal model of AR use and mammalian predator distribution was created. This model was supported by data from an experimental study of mice as vectors of AR, and was used to evaluate likely impacts of restrictions imposed on AR use in Denmark banning the use of rodenticides for plant protection in woodlands and tree-crops. The model uses input based on frequencies and timings of baiting for rodent control for urban, rural and woodland locations and creates an exposure map based on spatio-temporal modeling of movement of mice-vectored AR (based on Apodemus flavicollis). Simulated predator territories were super-imposed over this exposure map to create an exposure index. Predictions from the model concur with field studies of AR prevalence both before and after the change in AR use. In most cases, incidence of exposure to AR is predicted to be <90%, although cessation of use in woodlots and Christmas tree plantations should reduce mean exposure concentrations. Model results suggest that the driver of high AR incidence in non-target small mammal predators is likely to be the pattern of use and not the distance AR is vectored. Reducing baiting frequency by 75% had different effects depending on the landscape simulated, but having a maximum of 12% reduction in exposure incidence, and in one landscape a maximum reduction of <2%. We discuss sources of uncertainty in the model and directions for future development of predictive models for environmental impact assessment of rodenticides. The majority of model assumptions and uncertainties err on the side of reducing the exposure index, hence we believe the predictions to be robust and to indicate that the scale of the problem may be large. © 2016 Topping and Elmeros.", ALMaSS; Anti-coagulants; Mouse dispersal; Mustelid home-ranges; Secondary poisoning; Spatial modeling,0.0
499,Improving integration for integrated coastal zone management: An eight country study,"Integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) is a widely accepted approach for sustainable management of the coastal environment. ICZM emphasizes integration across sectors, levels of government, uses, stakeholders, and spatial and temporal scales. While improving integration is central to progress in ICZM, the role of and the achievement of integration remain understudied. To further study these two points, our research analyzes the performance of specific mechanisms used to support ICZM in eight countries (Belgium, India, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, UK, and Vietnam). The assessment is based on a qualitative comparative analysis conducted through the use of two surveys. It focuses on five ICZM mechanisms (environmental impact assessment; planning hierarchy; setback lines; marine spatial planning, and regulatory commission) and their role in improving integration. Our findings indicate that certain mechanisms enhance specific types of integration more effectively than others. Environmental impact assessment enhances science-policy integration and can be useful to integrate knowledge across sectors. Planning hierarchy and regulatory commissions are effective mechanisms to integrate policies across government levels, with the latter also promoting public-government integration. Setback lines can be applied to enhance integration across landscape units. Marine spatial planning is a multi-faceted mechanism with the potential to promote all types of integration. Policy-makers should adopt the mechanisms that are suited to the type of integration needed. Results of this study also contribute to evidence-based coastal management by identifying the most common impediments related to the mechanisms of integration in the eight studied countries. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.", Coastal Zone Management; Institutional success; Integration mechanisms; Policy-making; Qualitative comparative analysis; Sustainable development,1.0
500,"Integration of climate change considerations into environmental impact assessment — Implementation, problems and recommendations for China","Climate change plays an important role in affecting and altering the course of human development. So far, there have been no effective and efficient techniques to directly quantify the influences of climate change on human development, but there have been rough estimation and qualitative description of the effects. Since the 1990s, climate change considerations have been required to be included in environmental impact assessment, which is a flexible institutional framework of environmental risk evaluation and management. However, there have been no concrete achievements demonstrated. The purpose of this study was first to summarise the practical experience and to disclose the existing problems during the implementation of the process of integrating climate change considerations into environmental impact assessment in China through a case study. Currently in China, the practice of integrating climate change considerations into environmental impact assessment is mainly concentrated on the strategic environmental assessment level. The influences of climate change were identified as energy consumption, greenhouse gases emission, and the restraint of development under abnormal or extreme weather or climate conditions. Because of a lack of related technical guidelines and practical experience, the climate change considerations that have been selected and the evaluation methods that have been applied are quite different. Recommendations on policies, laws, and institutional regulations institution are proposed to better utilise environmental impact assessment to integrate climate change considerations into economic, social, and environmental decisions and actions. © Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.", Climate change considerations; Energy consumption; Environmental impact assessment; Greenhouse gases; Low carbon,1.0

This review advocates strategies by which ecological research and environmental-impact assessment in streams can be enhanced; particular attention is paid to study design and execution. Detection of anthropogenic impacts is discussed in the context of choice of biomonitors (benthic macroinvertebrates are emphasized), and the obstacles that sources of natural variability pose to the detection of environmental impacts. Well-founded predictions of ecological change and the effects of environmental impacts in tropical Asian streams and rivers depends upon a mechanistic understanding of the factors determining the structure and function of these ecosystems. Accordingly, the second part of this review concerns the design of process-orientated studies that could provide the information required to underpin effective stream conservation and management. The review concludes with a brief consideration of integrated approaches to stream and drainage-basin management, and a plea for scientists in tropical Asia to become more effective advocates of environmental protection in ""real-world' situations. -from Author", ,0.0
502,Environmental impacts of climate change adaptation,"Climate change adaptation reduces adverse effects of climate change but may also have undesirable environmental impacts. However, these impacts are yet poorly defined and analysed in the existing literature. To complement this knowledge-gap, we reviewed the literature to unveil the relationship between climate change adaptation and environmental impact assessment, and the degree to which environmental impacts are included in climate change adaptation theory and practice. Our literature review showed that technical, social and economic perspectives on climate change adaptation receive much more attention than the environmental perspective. The scarce interest on the environmental impacts of adaptation may be attributed to (1) an excessive sectoral approach, with dominance of non-environmental perspectives, (2) greater interest in mitigation and direct climate change impacts rather than in adaptation impacts, (3) a tendency to consider adaptation as inherently good, and (4) subjective/preconceived notions on which measures are good or bad, without a comprehensive assessment. Environmental Assessment (EA) has a long established history as an effective tool to include environment into decision-making, although it does not yet guarantee a proper assessment of adaptation, because it is still possible to postpone or even circumvent the processes of assessing the impacts of climate adaptation. Our results suggest that there is a need to address adaptation proactively by including it in EA, to update current policy frameworks, and to demand robust and reliable evaluation of alternatives. Only through the full EA of adaptation measures can we improve our understanding of the primary and secondary impacts of adaptation to global environmental change. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.", Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Environmental assessment; Environmental impacts; Secondary impacts,1.0

The plant can generate power, heating-cooling for residential applications, and hydrogen simultaneously from a single energy source. Both energetic and exergetic analyses are conducted on this multi-generation plant and its subsystems in order to evaluate and compare them thermodynamically, in terms of their useful product capabilities. The energetic and exergetic effectiveness of the multi-generation system are computed as 44.69% and 42.03%, respectively. After that, a parametric study on each of the subsystems of the proposed combined system is given in order to provide a deeper understanding of the working of these subsystems under different states. Lastly, environmental impact assessments are provided to raise environmental concerns for several operating conditions.

The Convention is the result of two years' work, set in train at the Environment for Europe Conference in Sofia, Bulgaria in October 1995, where Ministers declared 'we believe it is essential that, in accordance with Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration, States should give the public the opportunity to participate at all levels in decision-making processes relating to the environment'. Ministers called on all countries in the region 'to ensure that they have a legal framework and effective and appropriate mechanisms to secure public access to environmental information, to facilitate and encourage public participation, inter alia through environmental impact assessment procedures, and to provide effective public access to judicial and administrative remedies for environmental harm'. Accordingly, they recommended the development, with appropriate non-governmental organization involvement, of a regional convention on public participation. An ad hoc working group was established by the ECE Committee on Environmental Policy in January 1996, to prepare the draft Convention, Negotiations on the text formally opened in June 1996 and were concluded at the group's tenth session in March 1998.

Despite the remarkable aims, economic growth ambition of BRI may clash with the sustainability of the ecosystem given the scales of operations in environmentally sensitive regions, and the amount of material and energy needed. Therefore, the sustainable potential and environmental stewardship of the BRI will largely depend on the standard of strategic environmental and social management, and integration between China and partner countries of respective priorities, policies, and regulations. The effectiveness and compatibility of environmental impact assessment systems (EIA) remain largely unknown, especially across the diverse ecological, social, economic and political contexts represented in countries along the BRI.

507,On the environmental effectiveness analysis of energy policies: A case study of air pollution in the megacity of Tehran,"The present study compared different approaches to assessing the environmental cost-effectiveness of energy policy scenarios. As a case study, the megacity of Tehran in Iran was studied. A key policy challenge in this city is to curb high concentrations of PM2.5 and mitigate the associated adverse impacts. The results demonstrated that in the business as usual case, the spatially averaged primary and secondary PM2.5 concentration in Tehran will increase by 30% in the 2010–2030 period. Adopting certain planned policy scenarios and the corresponding pollutant concentration reductions in Tehran shows that although most of the emission comes from industrial activities around the city, the distribution of the transportation emission sources may play the most effective role in decreasing pollution levels in transport-related energy policies. Next, based on environmental damage costs and abatement costs in different pollution mitigation scenarios, the best (most environmentally cost-effective) scenarios were evaluated. The eco-efficiencies of the energy policies were assessed based on two proxies of environmental impacts: the reduced damage cost as a function of the reduced emission rates of the pollutants and the decreased number of polluted days in the year. In a sample area in which the simulated concentrations were verified by local measurements, the most efficient mitigation scenario would decrease the average concentration of PM2.5 by 35% in 2030 and the number of polluted days by 20%. These findings indicate how far the linear functionality of the damage cost from emission levels may mislead environmental impact assessments. This is due to neglecting the source distribution effects and geographical conditions of the environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.", Air pollution; Eco-efficiency; Energy; PM2.5; Tehran megacity,0.0

The purpose of this study is to develop an integrated decision-making method for EIA of tourism attractions in China by using the improved analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the extended picture fuzzy preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE) II method. Herein, picture fuzzy numbers (PFNs) are used to describe decision-makers’ preference, which can precisely express uncertain and hesitant information in the decision-making process. Then the improved AHP method based on expert mean assessment is used to obtain the weights of EIA of tourism attractions, which can reduce the spiteful assessment in the traditional AHP method. Based on the results of the improved AHP method, the picture fuzzy PRO-METHEE II method, which can consider the psychological behavior of decision-makers, is applied to assess candidate tourism attractions. Finally, an example of EIA of tourism attractions in China is provided to verify the effectiveness of the developed approach and the credibility of the results. © 2019 The Author(s).

509,Application of data envelopment analysis in environmental impact assessment of a coal washing plant: A new sustainable approach,"The main problem of traditional methods of environmental impact assessment (EIA) is that in most of the existing algorithms and methods, such as Leopold, Folchi and RIAM, the main attention is to the destructive effects of the proposed plan, and the advantages of the industrial project are less noticeable. This has led to a permanent challenge between environmental organizations and industrial stakeholders. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a new approach of assessing the industrial units. Besides, it considers the positive economic and social impacts of the project and provides a comprehensive assessment of the industrial unit. With this approach, the environmental impacts of an industrial unit have been considered as “inputs” and its positive economic and social impacts considered as the “outputs” of the DEA models. Therefore, the problem of impact assessment changes into a DEA model. In the present study, the Alborz Sharghi Coal washing plant in northern Iran has been considered as a case study for implementing the DEA-EIA approach, and 19 plant activities and 11 environmental components have been used to evaluate the environmental effects of the plant. To solve the EIA problem, two commonly used DEA approaches, called CRS (constant returns to scale) and VRS (variable returns to scale), have been used. The DEA results identified the critical environmental components of the plant that should be considered seriously. Also, drawing the “potential improvement” diagram in the DEA method is an effective tool for determining the high risk activities of the factory and applying them in development plans. Besides, using the VRS model with maximize-output approach showed that some of the plant activities had the most differences with optimal mode and these components should be considered in future development plans. Finally, it can be concluded that, assessing the environmental impacts of the mineral industries with VRS maximize-output approach, is closer to the concept of sustainable development and cost-benefit analysis. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.", Alborz Sharghi coal washing plant; DEA unit; Sustainable EIA; Total potential improvement,1.0

Noise pollution in particular has been the subject of much attention in recent years. The present situation in China regarding railway environmental noise is given in this paper. Emission standards and methods of measurement of railway noise on the boundary alongside the railway line (GB12525-90) is first introduced, followed by typical noise levels and spectra alongside main railway lines and the noise propagation pattern with distance (which have been monitored over decades). The primary sources of railway noise to residential communities include the whistling noise of locomotives, the noise of diesel locomotives and wheel/rail noise. According to the characteristics of these noise sources and their impacts, various effective noise control technologies have been adopted. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been well implemented for all new railway projects to ensure that the noise impact is given early consideration. However, increasing the speed on existing lines, constructing new high-speed passenger lines and developments of heavy freight transport are among the main improvement works of Chinese railways in the near future. Finally, there is a brief perspective of the key research objectives in the field of railway environmental noise. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", ,1.0
511,Walking the sustainability assessment talk - Progressing the practice of environmental impact assessment (EIA),"Internationally there is a growing demand for environmental impact assessment (EIA) to move away from its traditional focus towards delivering more sustainable outcomes. South Africa is an example of a country where the EIA system seems to have embraced the concept of sustainability. In this paper we test the existing objectives for EIA in South Africa against sustainability principles and then critique the effectiveness of EIA practice in delivering these objectives. The outcome of the research suggests that notwithstanding a strong and explicit sustainability mandate through policy and legislation, the effectiveness of EIA practice falls far short of what is mandated. This shows that further legislative reform is not required to improve effectiveness but rather a focus on changing the behaviour of individual professionals. We conclude by inviting further debate on what exactly practitioners can do to give effect to sustainability in EIA practice. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.", Effectiveness; Environmental impact assessment; Legislation; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable development,1.0
512,NONPARAMETRIC APPROACHES TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT,"ABSTRACT:  The interesting developments in non‐parainetric testing and estimation methods presented in the upcoming sequence of nine papers are evaluated, compared, and put into proper perspective. Because a deterioration in water quality constitutes a direct threat to human health, it is of utmost importance to have flexible non‐parametric methods available for detecting and describing trends in water quality time series. A distinct advantage of nonparametric tests is that they are usually very effective when applied to “messy” environmental data which may, for example, contain many missing observations and not be normally distributed. By applying their enhanced approaches for nonparametric methods to water quality time series, as well as employing well designed simulation experiments, the authors of the papers clearly demonstrate the efficacy of utilizing nonparametric tests in environmental impact assessment.

513,Evaluation of environmental impact assessment framework effectiveness,"In 2011, Greece reformed its Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) system publishing law 4014/2011 on the assessment of effects of certain public and private projects on the environment. However, six years since its issuing, no systematic evaluation has taken place to establish whether this legislative reform achieved its aims. In this paper, the results of an extensive EIA system effectiveness evaluation study which makes use of data from the first ever Greek EIA National Survey, additional in-depth interviews and a quality review of over 100 EIA statements are presented. The methodology involved an exhaustive legislative review juxtaposing the EU and Greek legislative provisions. Furthermore, in order to more holistically evaluate the effectiveness of the EIA system, a National survey was conducted, involving key EIA stakeholders (EIA Specialists and regional Environmental Authorities, as well as in the ministry officials). The results of the study highlight serious issues with the Greek EIA System depicting a chasm between new legal provisions and implementation in practice. The most significant weaknesses are located in the Alternatives, Non-technical Summary and Mitigation measure categories. It should be highlighted that the most significant reason for the insufficiency of the EIA system according to stakeholders is the fact that the supporting tools prescribed in the legislation (e.g. Electronic Environmental Registry) have not yet been activated Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.", ,1.0
514,Application of rapid impact assessment matrix and sustainability model in environmental impact assessment and operational optimization of solid waste transfer stations in Tehran,"Background and Objective: Municipal waste transfer stations (WTS), operate as middle elements in waste collection and transfer to the final disposal site. Besides their benefits in waste transportation cost reduction, WTS can cause negative environmental impacts such as noise, air, and water pollution. Environmental impact assessment is an effective solution to reduce the environmental impacts of WTS. This research was conducted at evaluating the environmental impacts of various options defined for WTS in Tehran using the Rapid Impact AssessmentMatrix (RIAM) analysis method. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was performed to assess the environmental impacts of WTS based on field observation and data collection. Comparing was included four options including: continue the current condition of the WTS, three other alternatives considered to be three other alternatives (WTS in open space with the construction of green space) and transfer in enclosed space and with construction of green space and without it. Finally, using the sustainability model, the stability of the options was also measured. Results: Based on the obtained results, the fourth option (indoor loading/ unloading along with establishment of green spaces in WTS) as the first priority for the Construction of transfer stations among the other options has the highest score (0.079) in terms of sustainability as well as the adverse environmental impacts. However, the current environmental status of Tehran WTS (first option) has the lowest score (-0.213) in terms of sustainability and the most destructive environmental impacts and found to be the last priority in establishment of transfer stations. Conclusion: Combined use of the RIAM and sustainability model can be a promising and reliable way to evaluate and improve the performance of (WTS). © 2019, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

515,Developing a strategic assessment and planning framework for the marine environment.,"Project-specific environmental impact assessments (EIA) have not provided government decision-makers with the required information at a stage in development planning when options are still available. The approach advocated in this paper is based on a review of the relevant literature and the results of a workshop held in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. Participants at that workshop developed a strategic assessment and planning framework for the offshore environment. The framework is considered to have several benefits, not the least of which are an expectation of more cost-effective project-specific EIA and a clarification of the roles of government and the proponent. -from Authors", ,1.0
516,"Integration of sectoral management activities in the coastal zone of the regione Abruzzo, Italy: The case of RICAMA","A river basin-oriented approach was developed to support the sustainable management of human activities in a coastal area of Regione Abruzzo, Italy. Consensus and collaboration between the public, different sectoral and territorial administrations, and the economic actors was identified as a crucial prerequisite for the long-term achievement of sustainable coastal development for this region and to make existing developments sustainable. The RICAMA (Rationale for Integrated Coastal Area Management) Project was set up on a regional scale to integrate the natural and economic information in a comprehensive integrated coastal planning, management, and development framework. To achieve this objective, 19 coastal municipalities, three provinces, and one regional government, each with their sectoral services (and their sectoral management activities), needed to be ""networked"" to promote effective sharing of information and a coordinated approach to management. A ""wide area network"" was developed that includes other authorities, stakeholders, and the general public. The methodology used to support the network is based on (i) suitable and updated information about the coastal state, (ii) use of informed maintenance strategies, (iii) use of Environmental Impact Assessment and Strategic Environmental Assessment for the assessment of goodness of projects/plans, (iv) adoption of an Environmental Management System for structuring the management actions at various (administrative) levels, and (v) adoption of soft intervention technologies.", Environmental management systems; ICZM; Information; Italy,1.0

Despite the fact that about 40 such assessments have been conducted so far, their outcomes have been piddling if we consider their actual influence in decision-making. SEA should not be limited to plans, programs or policies in economic sectors where major projects already require mandatory environmental impact assessments, but rather aimed primarily at public policies whose social and environmental consequences are barely known or largely ignored, such as macroeconomic policies. The value of SEA to decision-makers must be demonstrated to overcome distrust, especially among politicians who perceive SEA as reducing their discretionary power. Inevitably, SEA requires more transparency and better governance.

518,"Environmental impact assessment of the mining and concentration activities in the Kola Peninsula, Russia by multidate remote sensing","On the Kola Peninsula, the mining and concentration industry exerts anthropogenic impact on the environment. Tailing dumps cause airborne pollution through dusting, and waterborne pollution due to direct dumping and accidental releases. The objectives were: (1) to analyse multidate satellite images for 1964-1996 to assess the environmental pollution from the mining and concentration activity in the Kola in temporal perspective; (2) to evaluate remote sensing methods for integrated environmental impact assessment. • The area of mining and industrial sites steadily expands and amounted to 94 km2 in 1996. • The polluted water surface amounted to at least 150 km2 through dumping in 1978 and to 106 km2 in 1986 due to dusting. Thus, the impact from the mining and concentration activity should be reconsidered as more significant than it was officially anticipated. • In the past the main mechanism of pollution was direct dumping into the lakes. Currently and in future, airborne pollution after dusting storms will dominate. The effective recultivation of the tailing dumps will be a long-term process. • For effective assessment of impacts from the mining and concentration industry, remote sensing methods should be complemented by in-situ measurements, fieldwork, and mathematical modelling.", Mining-concentration industry; Multidate remote sensing; Pollution; Tailings; Waste,1.0
519,Impact assessment: Eroding benefits through streamlining?,"This paper argues that Governments have sought to streamline impact assessment in recent years (defined as the last five years) to counter concerns over the costs and potential for delays to economic development. We hypothesise that this has had some adverse consequences on the benefits that subsequently accrue from the assessments. This hypothesis is tested using a framework developed from arguments for the benefits brought by Environmental Impact Assessment made in 1982 in the face of the UK Government opposition to its implementation in a time of economic recession. The particular benefits investigated are 'consistency and fairness', 'early warning', 'environment and development', and 'public involvement'. Canada, South Africa, the United Kingdom and Western Australia are the jurisdictions tested using this framework. The conclusions indicate that significant streamlining has been undertaken which has had direct adverse effects on some of the benefits that impact assessment should deliver, particularly in Canada and the UK. The research has not examined whether streamlining has had implications for the effectiveness of impact assessment, but the causal link between streamlining and benefits does sound warning bells that merit further investigation. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.", Consistency and fairness; Cost and benefits; Early warning; Public involvement,1.0
520,A contribution for the evaluation of the territorial impact of transport infrastructures in the early stages of the EIA: application to the Huelva (Spain)–Faro (Portugal) rail link,"The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedure should predict and identify the major impacts of a project development that may cause specific spatial and temporal effects. Early in the EIA, the scoping stage provides all the relevant information on the impacts of the project alternatives. In particular, potential effects on the territorial network such as habitat connectivity loss and accessibility improvements should be taken into account in the various proposed layout alternatives when evaluating transport infrastructure projects. However, several authors have identified deficiencies in practice. The aim of this article is to provide a methodology for the assessment of these territorial impacts using adequate indicators in the early stages of the EIA procedure. The proposed method is based on a comparison of a range of alternative layouts for a railway line linking two population centres, using indicators calculated with geographic information systems. The methodology was applied to a case study – the rail link between Huelva (Spain) and Faro (Portugal) – and the high speed rail (HSR) and conventional rail were evaluated in different layouts. The method was effective in spatially identifying significant impacts on accessibility improvements, which occurred closer to the cross border area. The conventional railway alternatives have similar accessibility values to the HSR. The results also reveal that connectivity loss is not limited to the area around the infrastructure, but extends throughout the territory. The results are at variance with the initiative proposed by Spanish and Portuguese transport decision-makers, and raise the possibility of selecting a conventional railway option. An adequate territorial evaluation methodology enables the new action to be correctly assessed, and supplies the information required to propose the most suitable alternative from a socio-economic and environmental standpoint, regardless of whether this proposal was initially included in the transport policy. © 2015 University of Newcastle upon Tyne.", accessibility improvements; Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedure; habitat connectivity; transport planning,1.0
521,Flue gas suppression and environmental evaluation of deodorizer-modified rubber asphalt based on radar method,"Rubber-modified asphalt (RMA) is associated with impaired storage stability and additional harmful emissions during application. Microwave-oil bath activation of waste rubber powder (WRP) to improve its compatibility with asphalt. The treatment of VOCs and malodorous gas emissions from RMA is carried out using powder deodorizers, liquid deodorizers and their combination. The storage stability, high and low temp rheological behavior of RMA were investigated. The effects and machinations of three deodorants on odor removal and VOCs inhibition of RMA were explored. The emission indexes based on the characteristic pollutants of VOCs and malodorous gases were proposed to conduct a comprehensive environmental impact assessment by the Radar method. The results show that the activated WRP has a fluffier morphology and is better encapsulated by the oil film, which enhances the storage stability of RMA. The incorporation of deodorant has not altered the viscoelastic properties of asphalt. The higher specific surfaced areas and extensive pore structures was contributed to the adsorption of VOCs molecules from asphalt. VOCs and odor gases from asphalt could be inhibited by liquid deodorizers based on Lewis acid-base reactions, addition reactions, catalytic reactions, and redox reactions. LMA was the most effective in decreasing odorant gases, with reductions of up to 92.6% and 90.8% for isobutanol and dimethyl disulfide, respectively. PMA had the optimal inhibitory activity for vinyl chloride, which was 67.7%. The decrease of total concentration of VOCs in RMA by PMA (powder deodorant-modified asphalt), LMA (liquid deodorant-modified asphalt), and CMA (complex deodorant-modified asphalt) could be calculated as 51.7%, 34.1% and 46.7% respectively. RMA had a high load on the environment, and the overall advantage of CMA was greater. The environmental impacts of the four modified asphalts were ranked as CMA < PMA < LMA < RMA. Therefore, the utilization of powder and liquid compounding was recommended to improve the environmental impact of RMA. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd", Environmental evaluation; Radar chart method; Rubber-modified asphalt; VOCs emission,0.0

523,Predicting model of resource and environmental burdens for supporting the inventory analysis in welding,"The environmental impacts of welding have attracted huge attention and it became a significant basis to evaluate sustainable manufacturing process. To achieve the environmental impact assessment of welding, the consumption/emission of inventory data should be collected for supporting inventory analysis. Meanwhile, the consumption/emission of these substances in welding is affected by process parameters (such as current, voltage, welding speed, and gas velocity). These parameters were always considered and designed for achieving satisfactory mechanical properties and satisfying the requirements of assembly. However, since the relationship between welding parameters and input/output of inventory data is not clear, the inventory data needs to be re-collected when the process parameters are changed, which is tedious and time-consuming. Thus, a model is proposed for investigating this relationship, which can predict the consumption/emission of inventory data in welding. Moreover, the welding experiment was performed for verifying the effectiveness of the model. The results show that the consumption/emission of inventory data can be predicted and the deviation is changed in the range of 0 to 15%. Meanwhile, the carbon footprint of welding a concrete column framework was calculated for validating the applicability of the method, which demonstrated that the model can help engineers select the appropriate process parameters for achieving greener welding. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.", Environmental burden; Inventory analysis; Predicting; Resource burden; Welding,0.0

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been recognized as a crucial tool. This paper proposes the review of EIA in ASEAN countries in three key areas, namely legal enforcement, implementation approach and EIA effectiveness as the basis for a sustainable approach. The results showed that almost all the countries established their EIAs at the legal level with the complete EIA process; however, the implementation was somewhat different depending on the unique characteristics of the EIA processes. Such unique characteristics can be divided into three groups. The first belongs to the countries that initiated the EIA process before 1990, although they have their own outstanding topography, namely, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. The second group includes the countries that applied the EIA after 1990. The Asian Development Bank has played an active role and their EIA processes have rapidly developed especially EIA monitoring, Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Transboundary Impact Assessment. The countries in this group are Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. The last group contains the countries with stringent environmental regulations and is becoming part of environmental laws. They include Singapore and Brunei.

526,A life-cycle integrated model for product eco-design in the conceptual design phase,"Eco-design that addresses the consumption of resources and energy, as well as pollution emissions from a product life-cycle perspective, is an effective way to solve environmental problems. However, the optimal eco-design solution is hardly generated in the conceptual design stage due to the complex association of the life cycle design information. To this end, this paper proposes a new eco-design model based on a life cycle integrated framework to effectively manage life cycle information in the conceptual design phase. In this work, (1) The life cycle-oriented model is proposed to integrate the product design information in terms of a systematic association mechanism between function, structure, material and process to construct the design space. (2) A life cycle design scenario-based similarity matching method is developed to support the environmental impact assessment of design options in the design space. (3) A hope tree-based heuristic search algorithm with the principle of minimizing environmental impact is proposed to efficiently obtain the eco-design solution. An application for eco-design of the lift equipment is given to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method. The results show that the environmental impact of the generated eco-design solution is improved by 19.48%, and the material and use stage has the highest environmental impact which accounts for 39.59% and 47.74% respectively.

To achieve this goal, a quantitative analysis of the change in greenhouse gas emissions before and after the completion of 63 urban development projects spanning form 2013 to 2023 was conducted, with a focus on the carbon sink. The findings revealed that, in many instances, greenhouse gas storage and absorption via the carbon sink have decreased compared to the pre-implementation phase. Furthermore, issues such as uniform prediction of reduction measures were identified. Therefore, recommendations are provided for urban precise predictions and evaluations of impact in relevant areas during project execution, establishing measures.

529,Decision analysis for environmental impact assessment and consensus formation among conflicting multiple agents - including case studies for road traffic,"In this paper we propose how the utility theory of MCDM (multiple criteria decision making) and MADM (multiple agents decision making) can be effectively utilized for environmental impact assessment (EIA) of public projects. In the EIA we propose to include an assessment of the preferences of the regional inhabitants in addition to an assessment of the physical/biological effects of each pollution. For assessing the preference of the regional inhabitants we take into account the complex interdependence, called convex dependence, among multiple attributes when we construct a multiattribute disutility function. By using a multiattribute disutility function, we can evaluate the effectiveness of various countermeasures for preventing the environmental impact of a particular project. We also propose to include a consensus formation process among conflicting multiple agents such as regional inhabitants and the enterpriser (developer) of the project concerned. For this purpose we construct a group disutility function for two conflicting agents, taking into account the convex dependence between them. This is called the multi-agent utility theory. By using such a group disutility function, we can model the mutual concessions of the two conflicting agents, and hence we can expect fairer MADM for realizing better social welfare. Case studies of the EIA of road traffic, i.e. evaluation of countermeasures and consensus formation modeling among conflicting agents, are included. © 1994.", Consensus formation; EIA; MADM; MCDM; Utility theory,1.0
530,Analysis of environmental impact assessment practices and legislation in turkey,"In Turkey, as a developing country, environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a critical key for environmental protection. EIA is not regulated in Turkey by means of law, but through a decree put into force on the basis of the relevant provision of the Environmental Law. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) System, which embodies the “prevention principle” of the environmental law, is an important tool for environmental protection. This tool has a private importance for Turkey since it is a developing country, and it entered the Turkish law in 1983 with the Environmental Law. Besides, the EIA Regulation, which shows the application principles, became effective in 1993. Because Turkey is a candidate for European Union (EU), the EIA Regulation has been changed due to the EU compliance procedure, and its latest version became valid in 2014. This study aims to emphasize The EIA system in Turkey to supervise the efficiency of this procedure and point the success level. According to the methods, firstly In the introduction part, general EIA concept, its importance, and some notations are mentioned. Following that, the legislation, which builds the EIA system, has been analyzed starting from the 1982 Turkish Constitution.

531,Past local industrial disasters and involvement of NGOs stimulate public participation in transboundary Environmental Impact Assessment,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) emerged as a regulatory procedure and is now implemented worldwide. EIA aims to increase the sustainability of economic activities by decreasing the impact on environmental components. Transparency of the evaluation process is a key feature of the procedure, and this is achieved predominantly by encouraging participation in public debates. Public participation is essential for EIA's effectiveness, particularly in transboundary projects. This study evaluates whether media coverage of certain projects with transboundary environmental impacts increases public participation during EIA. We analyzed how online media covered the stories about four major projects subject to the EIA procedure in Romania (i.e., reactors 3 and 4 of Cernavoda Nuclear Power Plant, Oltenita used oil recycling facility, Certej mining project, management of Moldova Noua tailing ponds). We focused on articles published between 2010 and 2020, covering stories about the four projects. We further extracted the stakeholders involved in the projects using social network analysis. We extracted the main topics of articles discussing the four projects using deep categorization tools. The polarities of titles and contents of the articles were assessed using sentiment analysis tools. Our findings indicate that EIA is a media subject only when NGOs become important actors in the process and the industry generated local industrial disasters in the past; otherwise, the media rarely debate the environmental impact of projects. Without NGO reactions, Romanian readers are fed with political and economic aspects driven by large projects rather than environmental issues. The outcome of the current study is significant for understanding what triggers NGOs and the media to take a stand against major projects. Projects involving activities that generated ecological disasters in Romania's recent history are strongly opposed by NGOs and the public. In such cases, environmental and EIA topics are more often included in media stories. However, projects with undeniable environmental impact but without a negative background in Romania do not reach the public agenda, and the media stories do not focus on environmental aspects either, leading to limited public participation within the EIA procedure. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd", EIA; Public participation; Sentiment analysis; Social network; Transboundary projects,1.0
532,Development of Co−Nb−CeO2 Catalyst for Hydrogen Production from Waste-Derived Synthesis Gas Using Techno-Economic and Environmental Assessment,"A comparative study to obtain a cost-competitive catalyst was performed to produce hydrogen via the high temperature water gas shift (WGS) reaction using synthesis gas (syngas) derived from waste. First, several selected active metals on Nb−CeO2 support and preparation methods were applied to prepare highly active and stable catalysts under severe reaction conditions. Various characterization methods were employed to understand the correlation between catalytic activity and physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts. Among the Me−Nb−CeO2 (Me = Co, Cu, Fe, and Zn) catalysts, Co−Nb− CeO2 showed the highest activity at a high gas hourly space velocity of 315,282 mL·g−1·h−1 (temperature = 500 °C, XCO ≈ 84%). This was attributed to the high Brunauer−Emmett−Teller surface area and oxygen storage capacity of the Co−Nb−CeO2 catalyst. In addition, to investigate the effect of preparation method, various methods, including coprecipitation, incipient wetness impregnation, sol−gel, and hydrothermal methods, were applied for the synthesis of the Co−Nb−CeO2 catalyst. The Co−Nb− CeO2 catalyst prepared using the coprecipitation method exhibited high activity without significant deactivation for 60 h. This was attributed to the high oxygen storage capacity and intimate interaction between Co and the Nb−CeO2 support. Finally, techno-economic analysis and environmental impact assessment were performed for the Co−Nb−CeO2 catalysts, prepared by different preparation methods to identify the most promising catalyst for the production of hydrogen using the syngas derived from waste. By comparison with a commercial catalyst, it was shown that Co−Nb−CeO2 synthesized using coprecipitation is a promising, cost-effective, and eco-friendly catalyst with high activity. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

533,Dynamic and embedded evaluation procedure for strategic environmental assessment,"Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) represents a fundamental tool to guarantee the environmental sustainability of policies, plans and programs. Many national and international regulations in force, however, are not able to define a fair and shared methodology for SEA yet. What is more, environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures are widely described in literature, while there is still a lack in methodologies capable of evaluate all the involved elements in SEA; one of the main setbacks is the need of public participation during the procedure. The main disadvantage of available methods is the difficulty in correlating technical and social features.In the present work, a list of the major SEA available methods is presented, and a detailed analysis of the SEA procedure - according to Italian and European legislation - is proposed. Furthermore, an innovative dynamic, embedded and objective method is presented, in order to support the SEA. The proposed procedure is based on a multi-criteria analysis made by a matrix assessment. In particular, a new integrated system of indicators is proposed and described, which are able to evaluate both natural and socio-economic environmental aspects, for a sustainable development policy.Steps of explanation of objectives and action plan check, characterization of existing environmental status, identification and assessment of impacts and individuation of mitigation and compensation measures, assessment of residues impacts, verification of environmental compatibility and sustainability, and implementation of a monitoring program are the relevant points of the methodological approach developed, defined and subsequently discussed in its entirety in the present work.The dynamic and embedded evaluation procedure for strategic environmental assessment (DEEP-SEA) is able to ensure more effective information on plan contents, targeting choices to actions that can be able to achieve full compatibility and environmental sustainability, with the highest community consensus. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.", Analytical hierarchy process (AHP); Environmental impact assessment (EIA); Environmental indicators; Multi-criteria analysis; Public participation; Strategic environmental assessment (SEA); Sustainability; Urban planning,1.0

This study focuses on the life cycle environmental impacts of thermal protein extraction from microalgae biomass using ohmic heating. Coelastrella was selected as the model organism due to its double cell wall, which presents the worst-case extraction scenario. The environmental impact assessment was conducted using the ReCiPe 2016 method from an equalitarian perspective, encompassing eighteen environmental impact categories. The results demonstrate that applying an electric field of 217 V/cm during protein extraction significantly enhances extraction efficiency while simultaneously promoting a more environmentally sustainable performance. This is achieved through a rapid heating pulse that reaches a maximum temperature of around 100 °C, with a holding time of <1 s. In addition, an alternative energy scenario utilizing entirely renewable energy was evaluated for both the worst and best treatments identified in the LCA study, compared to the reference treatment. The results indicate improvements in at least fifteen of the eighteen indicators assessed under this renewable energy scenario. © 2025 The Authors", Coelastrella; Environmental impacts; Extraction efficiency; Renewable energy; Sustainability; Thermal extraction,0.0
535,The effects of sediment transport on contaminant dispersal: An example from Milford Haven,"Milford Haven is an estuary that has been subjected to industrial pollution from tanker operations and refinery and power station effluents since about 1962. Consequently build-up of various anthropogenic heavy metals and hydrocarbons has been observed in the bottom sediments. This paper describes 1. a new technique whereby the patterns of net sediment transport are determined from the relative changes of grain-size distributions in 125 grab samples, and 2. how net sediment transport correlates with the quantity of contaminants contained in the bottom sediments. The analysis demonstrates that sediment movement in the flood direction dominates the central channel and the northern half of the estuary. Transport in the ebb direction is confined to the southern coastal zone. A comparison of the transport paths with contaminant concentrations shows clearly that the flood-dominant movement leads to concentration of heavy metals and hydrocarbons. As a result, an area of fine-grained deposition near the head of the estuary receives exceptionally high concentrations of contaminants. The ebbdominant transport, on the other hand, causes dilution in the amount of pollutants contained in the sediments. The derived transport paths agree well with known current patterns, and this technique is shown to be a rapid and inexpensive method for 1. environmental impact assessment, 2. establishing effective monitoring programmes, 3. predicting areas vulnerable to contamination, and 4. rational contingency planning. © 1987.", ,1.0
536,"Knowledge management in environmental impact assessment agencies: A study in Québec, Canada","Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a knowledge intensive activity that benefits from a highly structured approach to knowledge management (KM). In a survey of KM initiatives in two Québec government agencies, the Environmental Assessment Department and the Environment Public Hearings Bureau, knowledge repositories were mapped and officers were invited to reply to a questionnaire enquiring about the knowledge repositories' usefulness. Their perception about knowledge creation within each agency was assessed. Three drivers were identified that have steered the implementation of KM initiatives: (i) successive managers' understandings that EIA does create knowledge; (ii) a concern with consistency and reproducibility of recommendations; (iii) improving agencies' efficiency, alongside one additional incentive: curbing the deleterious effects of staff turnover. So far an unmet challenge is making sense of a great deal of data and information obtained in the follow-up phase of the EIA process and transforming it into knowledge used to improve both efficiency and effectiveness of an agency's work. © Imperial College Press.", Canada; efficiency; environmental agencies; Environmental impact assessment; knowledge management; organizational learning,1.0
537,Peaks in bat activity at turbines and the implications for mitigating the impact of wind energy developments on bats,"Wind turbines are a relatively new threat to bats, causing mortalities worldwide. Reducing these fatalities is essential to ensure that the global increase in wind-energy facilities can occur with minimal impact on bat populations. Although individual bats have been observed approaching wind turbines, and fatalities frequently reported, it is unclear whether bats are actively attracted to, indifferent to, or repelled by, the turbines at large wind-energy installations. In this study, we assessed bat activity at paired turbine and control locations at 23 British wind farms. The research focussed on Pipistrellus species, which were by far the most abundant bats recorded at these sites. P. pipistrellus activity was 37% higher at turbines than at control locations, whereas P. pygmaeus activity was consistent with no attraction or repulsion by turbines. Given that more than 50% of bat fatalities in Europe are P. pipistrellus, these findings help explain why Environmental Impact Assessments conducted before the installation of turbines are poor predictors of actual fatality rates. They also suggest that operational mitigation (minimising blade rotation in periods of high collision risk) is likely to be the most effective way to reduce collisions because the presence of turbines alters bat activity. © 2021, The Author(s).", ,1.0
538,Appraising the sustainability of project alternatives: An increasing role for cumulative effects assessment,"Evaluating and comparing development alternatives with regard to sustainability is an important goal for comprehensive project appraisal. In the United States, this component has been largely missing from standard environmental impact assessment practice. Cumulative effects assessment provides a way to appraise the sustainability of project alternatives in terms of their probable contributions to long-term trends affecting the condition of valued environmental components. Sustainability metrics and predictors are being developed as criteria for rating systems and evaluation processes that are applied to community planning, building design, and transportation infrastructure. Increasing interest in adaptive management is also providing cost-effective solutions to optimizing safety and function throughout the long-term operation of a facility or infrastructure. Recent federal legislation is making it easier to integrate sustainability features into development alternatives through early, community-based planning. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.", Adaptive management; Cumulative effects; Mitigation; NEPA; SAFETEA-LU; Sustainability,1.0

540,"Scope for strategic ecological assessment of trunk-road development in England with respect to potential impacts on lowland heathland, the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) and the sand lizard (Lacerta agilis)","Environmental impact assessment (EIA) has a potential role in sustainable development. However, its commonest application has been at the project level, where it fails to ensure adequate consideration of potentially serious trans-boundary, widespread, indirect cumulative and synergistic ecological effects. The fact that ecological effects cannot be predicted or evaluated effectively if EIA is confined to single development actions and contrained by artificial boundaries is an important justification for moves towards the strategic application of EIA. The need for a more strategic approach to ecological assessment can be illustrated by reference to road development in the UK, where project-level EIA has failed to quantify the overall impact of new road development on biodiversity. Some form of strategic ecological assessment (SEcA) is required to ensure that proposed new road development is compatible with international obligations to conserve protected habitats and their associated species. In common with all forms of EIA, the effectiveness of SEcA depends on the ability to define the proposed action or set of actions and to characterize the receiving environment (baseline conditions). The ability to quantify potential impacts and to estimate their risk of occurrence is strongly dependent on the availability, accuracy, reliability and resolution of national data on the distributions of habitats, species and development proposals. This paper summarizes the results of a SEcA carried out to determine whether currently proposed road developments, when considered collectively, would be compatible with the safeguard of an internationally important and protected wildlife habitat (lowland heathland) and associated protected species. The study was carried out using a version of the Countryside Information System developed for the UK Department of the Environment by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology. Areas of lowland heathland are identified together with 'hot spots' where two protected lowland heathland species (sand lizard, Lacerta agilis and the Dartford warbler, Sylvia undata also occur. Possible risks attributable to proposed new road development are quantified for 1 km squares and evaluated on a county basis.", Environmental impact assessment; Heathland habitat; Rare species; Remote-sensing; Spatial analysis; Strategic environmental assessment,1.0
541,Environmental impact assessment (EIA): An overlooked instrument for sustainable development in Pakistan,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a policy tool used for evaluating a project proposal from physical and socioeconomic environmental perspectives. Its aim is to reduce the impact of development on environment, hence, ensuring environmental sustainability. It is mandatory to submit an Environmental Impact Statement before starting a mega project as required by Environmental Protection Act of 1997 and Environmental Policy of Pakistan. Public consultation plays a key role in an EIA system, identifying the likely aspects and impacts of a development activity. This aspect has been ignored in effective enactment of environmental legislation in Pakistan. Sufficient legislative instruments are there to support EIA system in the country but the agencies responsible for the enforcement of environmental regulations have failed to do so. The current research gives an insight into the actual status of EIA system in Pakistan along with the feedback of EIA specialists and university teachers of the concerned departments. A new index has been devised on the basis of questionnaire response to work out the overall performance of EIA system in Pakistan or any other country. The weaknesses and deficiencies of each EIA stage have been worked out for Pakistan and elaborated with the help of the controversial Zero point Interchange Project in the capital city of Pakistan. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.", Capital development authority; EIA index; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental protection agency Pakistan; Pakistan Environmental Protection Act (PEPA 1997); Zero point interchange project,1.0
542,"Head capsule deformities in Chironomus spp. (Diptera: Chironomidae) as indicator of environmental stress in Sebeta River, Ethiopia","Urbanization and industrialization have placed most of the aquatic environments in developing countries at great risk. The absence of reliable biological monitoring programmes further complicates the situation. In this study, an attempt was made to assess incidence of deformities among Chironomus spp. response to the level of environmental degradation. For this purpose, chironomid larvae were sampled from Sebeta River (November, 2012) using Surber sampler and/or D-frame dip net. Moreover, physico-chemical analysis of the water and sediment heavy metal analysis were carried out at three study sites. The results indicate that most physico-chemical variables were higher at the downstream sites (P < 0.05), together with high levels of Cr, Zn and Cu, which was attributed to untreated effluents that originated from garment and tannery industries. Several forms of deformities (mentum gap, notch, tooth missing and breakage) were encountered, and the majority occurred on mentum followed by pecten epipharynx. Taking 8% as a cut-off value for normal deformities and the moderate rate of deformities detected (16.62% at Sb-2), it is possible to conclude that the ecological state of Sebeta River is at critical condition. Therefore, corrective measures like designing of effective treatment plants and timely set environmental impact assessment must be in place prior to any developmental activity. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.", Chironomus spp.; Deformity; Sebeta; Water quality,0.0
543,Analysis of spatial planning documents and strategic environmental assessment reports with regard to hazards of major industrial accidents: a case study involving six Polish cities,"In the event of an accident in an industrial plant, the damage caused by it can be enormous. There may be environmental contamination in a large area. Injured persons may be both employees of the plant staying on its premises and local residents. The control of major accidents is realised by implementing the procedures regarding: safety analysis, emergency and operational planning, effective land-use planning (LUP), strategic environmental assessment (SEA), environmental impact assessment (EIA) and public consultation. The paper presents findings of a case study aiming to analyse selected spatial planning documents prepared at the municipality and SEA reports accompanying them, with regard to hazards of major industrial accidents in six Polish cities. In addition, changes of relevant Polish legislation taking place from 1995 till now are explained referring to European Union (EU) law. This article is the very first to present the situation concerning LUP around hazardous plants in Poland based on such extensive data. The assessment shows that the way of recording the major accident hazards is varied, but legal norms, binding at the time when the documents were drawn up, were met in each of the analysed documents. Changes of relevant Poland legislation were not the only reason for differences in the ways of recording the hazards of major industrial accidents in these documents. The case study has revealed that relevant Polish regulations can be still improved. The results of the study have useful implications for the control of major accidents, spatial policy-making and environmental management. © 2020, The Author(s).", Dangerous substance; Hazardous establishment; Land-use planning; Risk assessment; Safety distance; Sensitive environment element,1.0
544,Determining Vulnerability Importance in Environmental Impact Assessment. The case of Colombia,"The concept of vulnerability has been used to describe the susceptibility of physical, biotic, and social systems to harm or hazard. In this sense, it is a tool that reduces the uncertainties of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) since it does not depend exclusively on the value assessments of the evaluator, but rather is based on the environmental state indicators of the site where the projects or activities are being carried out. The concept of vulnerability thus reduces the possibility that evaluators will subjectively interpret results, and be influenced by outside interests and pressures during projects. However, up until now, EIA has been hindered by a lack of effective methods. This research study analyzes the concept of vulnerability, defines Vulnerability Importance and proposes its inclusion in qualitative EIA methodology. The method used to quantify Vulnerability Importance is based on a set of environmental factors and indicators that provide a comprehensive overview of the environmental state. The results obtained in Colombia highlight the usefulness and objectivity of this method since there is a direct relation between this value and the environmental state of the departments analyzed. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.", Colombia; Environmental Impact Assessment; Environmental Impact Process; Vulnerability,1.0
545,Evaluation and classification of public participation in EIA for transportation infrastructure megaprojects in China,"Public participation is an important aspect of environmental impact assessment (EIA) because of its prominent contribution to sustainable built environment. Developing countries, such as China, have attempted to promote the role of public participation in EIA. While comprehensive evaluations of public participation in EIA in China are still scarce, the government finds it difficult to develop policies to improve the status quo because of the ambiguity in the type of public participation. Therefore, this study collects EIA reports and evaluates their public participation sections, taking transportation infrastructure megaprojects as an example. The public participation index system is adopted to evaluate EIA reports between 2014 and 2021, and the k-means algorithm is used to classify the types of public participation based on the evaluation results. The results indicate that although the Chinese government is increasing its emphasis on public participation in EIA, the impact of public participation on environmental decision-making remains limited. Besides, public participation in China can be divided into three types: non-participation, passive participation, and interactive participation. Among them, non-participation has the largest proportion (61%) and is at the rung 2 “Therapy” of “Non-participation” level. Passive participation follows (23.4%) and is at rung 3 “Informing” or rung 4 “Consultation” of “Tokenism” levels. Interactive participation has the smallest proportion (15.6%) and is at rung 4 “Consultation” or rung 5 “Placation” of “Tokenism” levels. Third, The three participation types reveal three dilemmas: (1) Local governments do not pay attention to public participation in EIA; (2) the public is unwilling to actively participate in EIA; and (3) authorities do not consider broader comments. Fourth, it appears that airports, with their minimal footprint, are more successful in conducting effective public participation during EIA processes. Additionally, economic development has a positive influence on public participation in EIA. These findings help researchers and practitioners in the built environment improve the effectiveness of public participation activities. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.", China; Environmental impact assessment; Public participation; Transportation infrastructure megaprojects,1.0
546,A GIS and hybrid simulation aided environmental impact assessment of city-scale demolition waste management,"A considerable amount of demolition waste (DW) generated by urbanization and urban renewal has brought significant threats to the environment. However, there is a serious lack of environmental impact assessment towards city-scale demolition waste management (DWM), particularly from the systematical and dynamical perspective. Traditionally the assessment has been conducted from a static perspective. The purpose of this paper is to comprehensively evaluate the environmental impact of city-scale DWM from a complex system perspective. A novel evaluation model was developed by innovatively integrating the geographic information system (GIS) and system hybrid simulation consisting of system dynamics (SD), agent-based modeling (ABM) and discrete event simulation (DES). The proposed model was verified. Based on an empirical analysis of Shenzhen, China, it is found that the environmental impact of city-scale DWM is mainly concentrated in the central and northeastern regions of Shenzhen, demonstrating spatial heterogeneity and regional aggregation. Furthermore, the results reveal that the model is robust and effective to assess environmental impact from four aspects, i.e., land occupation, water pollution, air pollution and energy consumption. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the status quo of city-scale DWM and accompanying environmental impacts, and coordinating various district governments to formulate effective DWM policies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd", City-scale demolition waste management; Demolition waste; Environment impact assessment; Geographic information system; Hybrid simulation,1.0
547,"Energy, exergy, and environmental (3E) assessments of an integrated molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), Stirling engine and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) cogeneration system fed by a biomass-fueled gasifier","In this paper, a novel syngas-fed combined cogeneration plant, integrating a biomass gasifier, a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) unit, a Stirling engine, and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC), is introduced and thermodynamically analyzed to recognize its potentials compared to the previous solo/combined systems. For the proposed system, energetic, exergetic as well as environmental evaluations are performed. Based on the results, the gasifier and the fuel cell have a significant contribution to the exergy destruction of the system. Through a parametric study, the current density and the stack temperature difference are known as the main effective factors on the plant performance. Meanwhile, dividing the whole system into three sub-models, i.e., model (1): power production plant including the gasifier and MCFC without including Stirling engine, HRSG, and ORC unit, model (2): the cogeneration system without ORC unit, and model (3): the whole cogeneration system, an environmental impact assessment is carried out regarding CO2 emission. Considering paper as biomass revealed that maximum value of exergy efficiency is 50.18% with CO2 emissions of 28.9 × 10−2 t.MWh−1 which compared to the solo MCFC system indicates 28.40% increase and 13.3 × 10−2 t.MWh−1 decrease in exergy efficiency and CO2 emission, respectively. © 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC", CO<sub>2</sub> emission; Cogeneration; Gasification; Molten carbonate fuel cell; Organic Rankine cycle; Stirling engine,0.0
548,Tracing the inter-regional coal flows and environmental impacts in Jing-Jin-Ji region,"Coal, which plays a critical role in sustaining society development in Jing-Jin-Ji region (China), has become a controversial issue and has aroused extensive attention due to its impications with both climate change and human health. Based on the model of inter-regional transportation in Jing-Jin-Ji, we propose a Regional Coal Industry Chain Balance Table to define the full coal chain energy flows analysis framework. Besides, process chain analysis and input-output analysis are used for embodied energy accounting as well as for environmental impact assessment of 24 kinds of pollutants in the region. Results show that the direct use of raw coal represents a large proportion in Jing-Jin-Ji region's coal industry chain. By comparing the results from embodied energy analysis with the energy analysis findings, we can ascertain that coal chemical industry still keeps quite a small share of the energy consumption of coal industry chain. Coke is the main source of energy uses in final consumption, being also the key contributor in terms of embodied energy. In terms of final consumption, the industry keeps the vast majority of the use share (about 90%) in both direct and indirect flows. Consequently, a more effective control of industrial use of coal resources would play a fundamental role for improving energy efficiency and for decreasing pollution. The energy utilization efficiency of coal cleaning, coal products processing and coking of coal conversion in Jing-Jin-Ji region during year 2012 were 87.77%, 92.46 and 90.97%, respectively, i.e. a little less than the energy utilization efficiency of coal refining in China for the same year (96.16%). The direct use of raw coal, coke and the coking process were the key contributors to the 7 main pollutants of coal industry chain in Jing-Jin-Ji region 2012. Responding appropriately would improve the direct use of raw coal, coke and the coking process, while reducing the emissions of coal industry chain in Jing-Jin-Ji region. This study provides theoretical support and policy suggestions to increase the energy utilization efficiency, to reduce the consumption of embodied energy and to reduce the emissions of coal industry chain in Jing-Jin-Ji region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.", Embodied energy; Full coal supply chain; Input-output method; Jing-Jin-Ji region; Regional emission inventory,0.0
549,"The ‘grey’ assessment practice of IA screening: Prevalence, influence and applied rationale","Research focusing on the practices surrounding screening in Impact Assessment (IA) is limited. Yet, it has been found that development proposals sometimes are adjusted through an informal dialog with IA practitioners prior to or during screening. Such practice is often referred to as ‘grey IA’ in Denmark. This article explores the prevalence, influence and applied rationale of grey IA. Through a questionnaire, data was collected from 121 IA practitioners working within the fields of environmental impact assessment and strategic environmental assessment. It was found that grey IA is a common practice, which influences the outcomes of formal screening procedures through consideration of impacts on neighbours and spatial zones of protection. Grey IA is to some extent motivated by the opportunity to save the resources required for full-scale IA, but an additional ‘green’ rationale also exists. Grey IA may influence the effectiveness of IA systems, but further research is needed before any conclusions can be made. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.", ,1.0
550,A decision support system for environmental impact assessment in landscape degradation (case study: Shafarud watershed in gilan province of Iran),"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a critical appraisal of the likely effects of a policy, program, project, or activity on the environment. To assist the decision making authority, assessments are carried out independently of the proponent that may have prepared an environmental impact statement (EIS). Sometimes impact assessing methods, proposed alternatives, plans and the development of policy are against each other. Although EIA and environmental economical theories are useful facilities to measure the environmental capacities, the results are not always effective because of the measurement of quality. A Decision Support Systems (DSS) is a useful instrument for solving these problems. Degradation Model, as a Decision Support Systems, was first introduced in Iran. In this research, spatial data such as topography, hydrologie network, roads network in 1:25000 scale and land use in the 1:50000 scale are employed. Moreover, the physical landscape metrics are used to execute the landscape degradation assessment model. The landscape metrics are used instead of degradation parameters and human activities intensity. The landscape degradation is: LD= ∑kI/Vi Where LD is equal to degradation coefficient of landscape compartments, ∑kI is the index of intensity of human activities in landscape working units, I is the indicator of metrics and k is intensity of them) V stands for habitat vulnerability. According to McGarigal and Marks (1995), the list activities in landscape degradation model is as follow: Number of Patches in landscape (NumP), Median Patch Size (MedPS), Total Edge (TE), Edge Density (ED), Mean Patch Fractal Dimension (MPFD), Shannon's Diversity index (SDI) and Mean Shape Index (MSI). Landscape ecological metrics are useful instrument to interference ecology in planning and they help to measure the quantity of landscape processes. At first, all the landscape metrics should be determined for each sub watershed and then the scope of each metric in each sub watershed will be categorized based on the median. The median is a number that divides data into equal parts. In other word, it shows which part is the bigger 50%, and which part is the smaller than 50%. To achieve this, Excel program is used. In the next step, the total metrics is considered as collection of landscape degradation activities. Activities are categorized in terms of quality in 4 classes: Code (1) Insignificant degradation, Code (2) Medium degradation, Code (3) Intense degradation, Code (4) high intense degradation. After comparing activities intensity (different metrics) with median scale, the intensity of each activity has been determined in working unit. One method to determine vulnerability is quantitative landscape by extracting, landscape metrics. Based on ecological landscape principals, when number of patches in ecosystem is fewer or when there is equal in land use in an ecosystem or sub watershed, the ecosystem is exposed to much less vulnerability. The number of patches in landscape (Nump) is used to determine the ecological vulnerability. Table 1 shows the level of vulnerability in Shafarud watershed. Table 1: Vulnerability level in Shafarud landscape Table Presented To apply the landscape degradation model we considered Shafarud watershed that is located in Gilan. Figure 1 Show the study area. (Figure Presented) Fig. 1: Location of the Shafarud watershed in Gilan, Iran Table 1 shows degradation scope in Shafarud watershed based on development & protection ratio according to the fuzzy logic classification.

551,"Conceptual Dimensions to Evaluate the Effectiveness of the Environmental Impact Assessment, under Peruvian Environmental Legislation; [DIMENSIONES CONCEPTUALES PARA EVALUAR LA EFECTIVIDAD DE LA EVALUACIÓN DEL IMPACTO AMBIENTAL, BAJO LA LEGISLACIÓN AMBIENTAL PERUANA]","30 years after its implementation in the national legislation of Peru, the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been revised in order to determine which indicators could be used to evaluate its effectiveness. Sources of information on the quality and effectiveness of the EIA for the sustainable use of natural resources were analyzed, achieving a conceptual model of a value chain for results-based management from the public administration, identifying the inputs and activities to offer a service of environmental certification that specifically results in the sustainable use of natural resources, and contributes to the enjoyment of a balanced and adequate environment for the development of life. From the review made to Chanchitpricha and Bond (2013), Bond et al. (2015) and Pope et al. (2018), among 39 others, we distinguish six (06) dimensions that allow evaluating the effectiveness of the EIA, referring to the sustainable use of natural resources, which are: i) normative, reaching the goals established in the policies; ii) participatory, safely and reliably involving stakeholders; iii) organizational, facilitating the management of knowledge about EIA as a tool for environmental management; iv) transactional, efficiently managing resources in the execution of the EIA, such as time, finances, scope or requirements and personnel skills; v) procedural, due to a consistent and reliable procedural framework; and, vi) substantive, due to the effectiveness of the decision made by the competent authority regarding the environmental viability of the project submitted to the EIA. This paper is a contribution to further studies on the effectiveness of EIA in addressing the environmental and social problems that we currently face, and the possible trends to appear in future decades. © 2021, Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru.

552,Integrated environmental assessment (IEA) of groundwater depletion in Ardebil plain for management solutions,"1. Introduction Management and decision-making issues related to water resources, especially groundwater, which is an important source of fresh water, is the main decisions of a country. According to population growth and increasing demand as well as lack of water, proper management of these resources will be needed. So, integrated environmental assessment is one of the best and most effective tools in determining the economic, social and environmental problems. In reviewing previous studies, most research is done on the effects of groundwater depletion or Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) before and after construction of a project or plan and there is less comprehensive view in social and economic dimensions of the environment. In this study, overview and integrated research on the causes and effects framework of groundwater depletion is used and Integrated Environmental assessment (IEA) as a main methods in water resource management, survey all present and future threats. So, IEA can be used in environmental planning and management towards sustainable development. mDSS software has been used in the field of surface waters at the international level but this application isn't used in IEA for GW depletion. The study area is Ardabil plain, in Ardabil province in the northwest part of Iran. Ardabil plain area is about 853 km2, and groundwater using has been raised during the past half century because of increasing population and agriculture development. Now, the plain decline is close to 10 m. 2. Materials and Methods This study prepared by library documents, interviews and a questionnaire filling out by academics and experts. Integrated assessment should be provided in the form of a conceptual model called DPSIR to link between the data collected. The DPSIR framework aims in analyzing the cause-effect relationship between interacting components of complex social, economic and environmental systems and in organizing the information flow between its parts. Driving forces (D) represent major social and economic developments in societies and the corresponding changes in lifestyles, overall levels of consumption and production patterns. As an effect of driving forces, the pressures (P) are developed. The pressures represent processes affecting the resources (land, water) by producing instance substances (emissions), physical and biological agents which consequently cause changes to the state of water resources (S). Depending on the changes of state, positive or negative consequences of society may occur. These consequences are identified and evaluated to describe impacts (I) by means of evaluation indices. In a generic decisional context, the perception of the existence of relevant impacts in the catchment area induces decision-makers to develop responses (R) which prevent, compensate, or mitigate the negative outcomes of state changes. Responses may be targeted to address the driving forces, the pressures or the state itself: either the driving forces may be re-organized (prevention, changing behavior, etc.), pressure mechanisms may be altered (e.g. the introduction of new production systems), or the state of the environment may be restored or adapted to reduce its sensitivity to pressures. Software of mDSS (MULti-sectoral, INtegrated and Operational Decision Support System) is a useful application to support decision-making on issues related to water resources management and solving complex problems arising from it. The software mDSS also integrates environmental modeling techniques, social and economic in GIS with multi-criteria decision-making techniques (MCDMs). 3. Results Among the various indicators, according to expert's opinion, population growth and agricultural development are the most important factors (driving force) in groundwater declining. Land use and water consumption were considered as pressures. Depletion of groundwater that is the subject of this study is state and loss of water quality, the amount of surface water as well as increased vulnerability to drought (dry gardens and agricultural lands) are considered as the effects of this research respectively. Climate Change. To evaluate the changes in climate, the temperature and precipitation data obtained from synoptic stations of Ardabil and evaporation data obtained from hydrological stations. The results of homogeneous data series, according to Mann-Kendall test, show the trend of rising temperature and evaporation, so could be one of the factors in groundwater declining. Population Growth. To assess the impact of population growth on groundwater resources, Ardabil population data were collected from 1355/1976 to 1390/2011. The results show increasing demand of groundwater in agriculture, industry and drinking. Agricultural Development. More than 88% of water consumption in agriculture is supplied by numerous wells drilled in the plain area. By studying agriculture in three parts (the area under cultivation, production and type of products), we found that from 662, 063 ha of land, 434, 541 ha are rain-fed land and 227, 522 ha are irrigated, but much crop growth is in irrigation products. Product types were examined in this study, too. Potato cultivation in the Ardebil plain that is the first place in Iran (about 14 percent), takes place with irrigation method, which can cause overuse of groundwater. Land Use. In this study, Landsat images between June 1987 and 2014 were analyzed. Results classified by Maximum Likelihood method, reveals that made lands (29%) and pastures (21/5%) increased, while agricultural land and water have been reduced. One reason for the loss of agricultural land and surface water, is declining groundwater. Groundwater Consumption. According to the latest inventory of existing wells, 0.8% of wells are industrial, 8% drinking and 91.2% agricultural consumption. State. Ardabil plain area is about 850 ha that has 3667 deep and semi-deep wells. In this study, we selected wells data in 1987 compared with the same data in 2014. By Kriging interpolation, we found that the depletion of GW in the South is much more increased, up to 83 m. Changing Water Quality. In this study, water conductivity indicator (EC) was used over a period of 12 years. The average annual EC's increasing from 834 umho/cm (in 2000) to 1170 umho/cm (in 2010). Reducing the amount of Surface Water. In this study, data from Gilandeh, Kuzetapraghi and Gharehsou stations, over a period of 1978- 2010, shows reducing these river's discharging is clearly visible. Responds. Based on the questionnaires, the best strategy is to improve the agriculture. Four important strategies defined by a hypothetical scenario. These scenarios include: 1. Part Participation (P.P) in watershed management under the supervision of co-operative plain and cooperation of non-governmental organization 2. Changing in G.W Cultivation Pattern (C.G.W) 3. Trying to create New Systems (N.S) and change traditional irrigation systems 4. Changing the Cost of Price (C.C.P) especially in the agricultural sector in order to reduce excessive consumption and increase savings.(Figure presented) 4. Discussion and Conclusions The results obtained from testing the Decision Support System 'mDSS' software. In this typical application, the first step is to identify the socio-economic and environmental characteristics are described according to the DPSIR conceptual framework in Conceptual Phase. Then we describe the alternative options, with selecting the decisional criteria like Simple Additive Weighting method (SAW), one of the Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM). This modeling is stored in the Analysis Matrix (AM). The AM is structured with indicators in the columns and options in the rows. The AM matrix is placed in Design Phase in mDSS software. The evaluation, normalization and weighting of options are done on Evaluation Matrix (EM) in ""Choice Phase"". In this study, weighting is done on a priority basis by Swing Weighting. In this way GW depletion ranked first, (No. 1) agricultural water consumption ranked second (No. 2), population growth ranked third, and so on, GW consumption, surface water, land use changes, changes in water quality and drought. It should be noted that final assessment that means prioritizing of responds or options is also done by using Simple Additive Weighting method (SAW).

553,Application of geospatial technologies for environmental impact assessment: An Indian Scenario,"Geospatial technology is an essential component of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process, as environmental resources are directly affected by changes in the shape and extent of the proposed disturbance. With the use of spatial techniques like remote sensing, Geographical Information Systems, and Global Positioning Systems, EIA has enhanced substantial viewing, movement, query, and even map-making capabilities. However, one of the main challenges is to have access to the most up-to-date and accurate geospatial data and interpretations. With an emphasis on using geospatial data in particular, the value of the information resource is far higher than is generally available with text and numeric information. This paper focuses on discussing the application of geospatial tools in environmental monitoring and the effective analysis of the natural resources for developmental planning, policy formulation, and decision-making. Several specific relevant applications of geospatial tools to integrate EIA are presented in the context of an Indian scenario. Applications have included monitoring of natural resources (air, water, land, etc.), ground-level ozone, soil erosion, study of sea-level rise due to global warming, change-detection studies, delineation of ecologically sensitive areas using digital-image analysis and Geographic Information Systems. This study focuses on the possibility of using a proposed spatial-decision-support system to conduct EIA, which should make it possible to upload, evaluate, maintain, and report field and analytical data that have been stored in a variety of formats.", ,1.0
554,Effectiveness analysis of planning environmental impact assessment based on multiple indicators: taking industrial parks as an example; [基于多指标的规划环评有效性分析— 以 产 业 园 区 为 例],"To better improve the effectiveness of the planning environmental impact assessment (PEIA), twenty-six cases of industrial park PEIA were selected as examples to construct an indicator system to analyze the implementation achievements and inadequacies of industrial park PEIA. The indicator system included four dimensions and 14 indexes, with the four dimensions being promoting improvement of regional environmental quality, optimizing spatial layout, preventing and eliminating of environmental risks and promoting high-level development of the park. The results showed that PEIA of industrial parks had achieved remarkable substantive effectiveness results in implementation of total amount control and performance requirements, implementation of industrial admittance restrictions, protection and avoidance of environmental sensitive areas, and implementation of tracking and supervision plans. However, there still remained inadequacy in complete supporting sewage treatment facilities, coordination of residential environment and security risks, cleaner production and circular economy development. In terms of park levels, the implementation effects of PEIA of national industrial parks were better than that of industrial parks at provincial level and below, and as to time periods, the industrial parks passing examination during or after the 13th Five-year Plan period were better than before, with the strengthening of the guidance and reform promotion of industrial park planning EIA at the national level. In terms of regions, the eastern region had a strong economic foundation and early implementation of EIA, paid more attention to the role of PEIA as a preventive tool in promoting high-quality development, and thus was more capable than the other regions to implement and enforce the recommendations of PEIA. Based on problem orientation, some suggestions were proposed including enhancing industrial park environmental management, strengthening PEIA tracking and supervision, and promoting the joint participation of multi-departments in the preparation and implementation of PEIA. These proposals could provide references for the management departments to strengthen management of industrial park PEIA and promote the implementation of PEIA outcomes. © The Author(s) 2022.", indicator system; industrial park; planning environmental impact assessment (PEIA); substantive effectiveness,1.0
555,Beyond the requirements: Improving public participation in EIA,"Virtually every environmental planner at some time deals with environmental impact assessment (EIA). Public participation is required in most environmental impact assessment programmes around the world. However, citizen involvement is often reduced to a procedural exercise instead of a substantive process to include the public in environmental decision making. This paper examines public participation in EIA and provides ways to improve its effectiveness. We first examine the rationales for public involvement and its institutionalization through EIA. Next, we analyse the shortcomings and strengths of common approaches to public involvement. Our analysis, supported by two case studies, suggests that going beyond the minimum requirements can benefit the public, the project proponent and the final plan. We conclude with practical steps to improve public participation programmes in environmental planning and decision making.", ,1.0
556,Deep-Sea DC Resistivity and Self-Potential Monitoring System for Environmental Evaluation With Hydrothermal Deposit Mining,"Environmental impact assessment has become an important issue for deep-sea resource mining. The International Seabed Authority has recently developed recommendations for guidelines on environmental assessment of resource mining effects. Several research and development groups have been organized to develop methods for environmental assessment of the seafloor and sub-seafloor under the “Zipangu in the Ocean program,” a part of the Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program managed by the Cabinet Office of the Japanese government. One attempt planned for long-term environment and sub-seafloor structure monitoring uses a cabled observatory system. To support this observatory plan, we began development of a system to monitor the sub-seafloor resistivity and self-potential reflecting the physicochemical properties of ore deposits and the existence of hydrothermal fluid. The system, which mainly comprises an electro-magnetometer and an electrical transmitter, detects spatio-temporal changes in subseafloor resistivity and in self-potential. Because of the project’s policy changes, cabled observatory system development was canceled. Therefore, we tried to conduct an experimental observation using only a current transmitter and a voltmeter unit. Data obtained during three and a half months show only slight overall apparent resistivity variation: as small as 0.005 Ω-m peak-to-peak. The electrode pair closest to the hydrothermal mound shows exceptionally large electric field variation, with a semidiurnal period related to tidal variation. Results indicate difficulty of explaining electric field variation by seawater mass migration around the hydrothermal mound. One possibility is the streaming potential, i.e., fluid flow below the seafloor, in response to tides. However, we have not been able to perform rigorous quantitative analysis, and further investigation is required to examine whether this mechanism is effective. The system we have developed has proven to be capable of stable data acquisition, which will allow for long-term monitoring including industrial applications. © Copyright © 2021 Kasaya, Iwamoto and Kawada.", DC resistivity; environmental impact assessment; long term monitoring; self-potential; streaming potential,1.0
557,Evaluation of environmental impact assessment report preparation and public participation in landfill projects in Nepal,"This study examined the effectiveness of environmental impact assessment (EIA) in landfill development projects for Kathmandu Valley municipalities in Nepal using a survey, focus group interviews, expert interviews, and observations. The study found that EIA reports are often prepared by incompetent contractors that are not accredited and the reports are poor in quality, too technical, mostly published in the English language, cluttered with irrelevant materials, too long, and frequently contain information copied from other documents. The survey results showed that 66% of the respondents were unaware of any public meetings conducted for EIA in the current landfill location, 69% of them were uninformed of any alternate landfill locations, 91% were unsatisfied with the governmental services provided, and only 14% were happy with the public participation conducted. Findings from other proposed landfill locations and an old landfill site corroborated that the government fell short in conducting EIA or upholding Nepal's environmental law, thus undercutting public support in such projects. In some cases, retroactive EIA was being conducted to create the appearance that the required procedures were followed, which clearly violated the spirit and elemental principle of the apparatus. In other cases, political parties endorsed EIA in place of public hearings. To rectify flaws in EIA and maintain quality and accepted rigor of EIA in solid waste management (SWM), it is suggested that Nepal devise EIA guidelines for the SWM sector that are more appropriate for local conditions, build institutional capacity, accredit EIA drafters, use alternate methods to notify people about proposed activities, and seek public participation and ownership in the project from the beginning. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", Developing countries; Environmental impact assessment; Kathmandu; Landfills; Nepal; Solid waste management,1.0
558,Transparency in environment impact assessment decision-making: Recent developments in Western Australia,"Transparency in decision-making, involving the establishment of explicit goals and objectives combined with open, facilitative procedures, has recently been advocated as an important principle for effective environmental impact assessment (EIA). This paper examines recent changes to EIA practice in Western Australia that emphasise clear procedures for decision-making. Current practices focus on objectives established for relevant environmental factors identified during the screening and scoping stages of EIA. These objectives are then used as decision criteria for project decision-making following public review. An example from a recent assessment is provided. Some strengths and weaknesses of this approach to transparent EIA decision-making are also examined. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", Decision-making; Effectiveness; Transparency; Western Australia,1.0

Our study shows that the EIA system of India is undergoing a transitional period. In the 1994 EIA Notification, public hearings are included that ensure the voice of the general people in decision-making for sustainable development. A reverse scenario has been seen in the EIA Notification of 2006 and 2020, respectively, where public participation is almost overlooked, and the high interests of the proponents are taken into consideration. Issues like post-facto clearance and limiting public consultations regarding the proposed projects are the biggest obstacles in EIA Notification 2020. Our study also reveals that although the recent amendment quickens obtaining the Environmental Clearance (EC), it brings forth other problems like corruption, lack of transparency, false and fabricated data, poor monitoring etc that hinder the way of effective EIA system in India. © 2022, Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences, University of Bologna.

When judging a system, it is important to consider its effectiveness objectively. The effectiveness of EIA is reflected in the entire process of system construction, system implementation, and taking effects, with multidimensional meaning. Aming at sustainable development of economy, society and environment, an evaluation framework of China's EIA system was explored and constructed based on the logic chain of ""institutional basis→practical process→taking effects→social cognition"", from four aspects of system effectiveness, procedural effectiveness, substantial effectiveness and cognitive effectiveness. Combined with the EIA system design and implementation mode of China, a set of scientific and applicable effectiveness evaluation indicators, with both practicality and flexibility, were proposed. These could provide ideas for objective and systematic assessment of China's EIA system, as well as reference for the establishment of a mechanism for tracking evaluation of the effectiveness of China's EIA system and for supporting its reform and optimization. © 2022 The Author(s).", effectiveness; environmental impact assessment (EIA); evaluation framework; evaluation indicators,1.0
561,Prioritizing highway defragmentation locations for restoring landscape connectivity,"Transport infrastructures are a major driver of global landscape change. In many areas, highways were built before environmental impact assessments required the implementation of wildlife crossing structures. A fundamental task in the development of ecological networks is identifying areas where dispersal pathways of vulnerable populations may be blocked or affected by high volume roads. Financial considerations may limit investment, thus it is vital to establish the relative contribution of each road defragmentation location to upholding habitat connectivity and availability. In this paper, recent methodological developments in habitat network analysis, derived from the probability of connectivity index, were refined and used to evaluate the role of each highway defragmentation location in restoring landscape connectivity. The forest protected area network in the Basque country (northern Spain) was selected as an illustrative case study. The proposed approach was able to quantify and effectively account for a combination of factors determining the contribution of each highway defragmentation location to upholding connectivity, which are rarely jointly considered in analyses oriented to support restoration decisions in landscapes affected by the barrier effect of transport infrastructures. The contribution to connectivity of each defragmentation location depended on its topological position in the landscape, on the relative decrease in the effective distance among habitat areas that results from the permeability restoration at that location, on the distance from the defragmentation location to other alternative wildlife crossing structures already existing in the landscape, on the amount of habitat in the areas connected by the linkages that run through the defragmentation location and on the dispersal abilities of the focal species. © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2013.", ecological networks; graph theory; highway defragmentation; landscape connectivity; road ecology,1.0
562,"Quality of federal level strategic environmental assessment – A case study analysis for transport, transmission grid and maritime spatial planning in Germany","Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) emerged from Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and was developed based on the procedural steps and understanding thereof, but with the goal to fulfil a more ‘strategic’ function. Federal level plans and programmes constitute the highest planning levels in Germany subject to SEA, as SEA for policies is not compulsory. In this article, we analyse the quality and procedural effectiveness of federal level SEA in Germany with the underlying hypothesis that federal level SEA might be more strategic than SEA at other planning levels, as it represents the highest tier. Therefore, we analysed three federal level SEA case studies in Germany according to a set of criteria and indicators based on international research outcomes, including SEA integration into decision-making, tiering, scoping, selection and assessment of alternatives, cumulative effects assessment, public participation, and monitoring. Results demonstrate that the procedural effectiveness of SEA practice at the federal level is limited in Germany, and the making of SEAs proved not to be as ‘strategic’ as its important role prior to subsequent planning processes and outcomes would suggest. Reasons include an alternatives assessment restricted to macro-siting instead of assessing scenarios of demand or system alternatives, tiering limited to general advice without specific guidance for subsequent planning levels, cumulative effects assessment limited to intra-plan effects, a lack of monitoring, and public participation limited to consultation on the environmental report. These findings support results from a variety of international studies. Reasons for limitations have been identified in current SEA regulations, prior policy-making, institutional settings, the institutions’ willingness to learn and limited quality management by the German Federal Environmental Agency. Thus, our recommendations aim to improve quality management and learning by initiating a federal level SEA forum to discuss federal level planning and SEA practice and related issues, expanding the federal EIA portal to SEAs, quality management by the German Federal Environmental Agency in every federal level SEA scoping process and for every federal level environmental report, and further research and development to improve SEA practice. However, the general question for SEA research might be whether SEA contributes to long-term institutional learning processes beyond individual SEA processes, and how those learning processes can be supported, for instance by quality management and capacity building. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.", Case study analysis; Evaluation; Germany; Impact assessment; Optimacy; Procedural effectiveness; Strategic environmental assessment,1.0

This report reviews the characteristics and assesses the effectiveness of health impact assessments (HIAs) conducted in this sector. A total of 30 HIAs conducted in 14 states in the United States were identified using a targeted literature search. Five HIAs illustrative of the different source and sub-sector categories, and with identifiable impacts on decision-making processes were selected for review. An existing conceptual framework (Wismar) was used to assess the effectiveness of the five selected HIAs on decision-making related to non-renewable energy, renewable energy, mining, and energy conservation. The 30 HIAs were performed for a variety of projects and assessed health impacts ranging from metabolic disorders to community livability. Eight of the 30 reports were incorporated into environmental impact assessments. All five selected HIAs were generally effective and raised awareness of the health effects of the projects being assessed; four were directly effective and led to changes in final project decisions. Their variable effectiveness may be related to the extent of community engagement and consideration of equity issues, differences in the details and quality of monitoring and evaluation plans devised as part of the HIA process, and whether the outcomes of monitoring and evaluation are reported. © 2018, © 2018 IAIA.", decision-making effectiveness; energy and natural resources; Health impact assessment; United States; Wismar framework,1.0
564,Eco-energy and urbanisation: Messages from birds about wind turbine proliferation,"By 2010, 51% of humans live in cities, rising to 70% by 2050. Energy consumption increases exponentially with the proportion of the populace living in conurbations. Fossil fuels supply 85% of global human energy, yet many acknowledge the need to switch to renewable sources, especially given recent concerns over nuclear power safety. Finland will consume 14% more electrical energy by 2035, plus another 14% were the country to switch to electric cars. Such increased demand could be met by 2730 × 2.3 MW wind turbines (covering 1050 km 2 of sea). Wind turbines may cause displacement from bird feeding areas, barriers to movement, modifications to habitats and collision mortality. Effective implementation of Strategic Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Assessment should guide sensitive positioning of wind farm development to avoid conflicts with avian populations.

The thermodynamic, economic assessment and environmental impact of deploying the solar dryer were investigated. For, this reason a mix-mode solar dryer with V- groove collector loaded with granite bed as thermal storage was developed at the Faculty of Sciences and Techniques of Tangier, Morocco. Drying of the potato chips took 4.5 h at a collector efficiency of 60.08%. Solar radiation heat contributed 78.18% of energy utilization while the granite bed thermal storage contributed 21.82%. The effectiveness of energy utilization embodied in specific energy consumption was determined as 6.109 kWh/kg and the specific moisture extraction rate was deduced as 0.1637kg/kWh. Wang/Singh and Midilli/Kucuk models presented the best kinetic models for predicting the potato drying kinetic in the mixed-type dryer and open sun drying, respectively.

567,Performance and Sustainability of Organic and Conventional Cotton Farming Systems in Egypt: An Environmental and Energy Assessment,"Cotton cultivation is resource-intensive, posing significant environmental challenges, especially with conventional farming methods. Growing interest in sustainable agriculture drives the exploration of organic farming as a potential alternative with lower environmental impacts. Despite its benefits, organic farming often faces criticism for lower crop yields, sparking debates on the trade-offs between productivity and environmental impact. This study hypothesizes that organic cotton farming will have a smaller environmental footprint and higher energy efficiency compared to conventional methods. To test this hypothesis, a cradle-to-farm gate energy analysis and life cycle assessment (LCA) were conducted on both organic and conventional seed cotton production systems in the Beheira governorate of Egypt. The ReCiPe 2016 midpoint and endpoint characterization model was used for an environmental impact assessment. The impacts were evaluated using two functional units: one ton of seed cotton and one hectare of cultivated cotton. The findings revealed that organic cotton outperforms conventional cotton in net energy gain, efficiency, and profitability, with higher productivity and lower energy intensity. Regardless of the functional unit used (mass- or land-based), the assessed organic systems generally show a better environmental performance than the conventional systems in the local context, even when accounting for data uncertainty. This is due to lower input intensity and the use of less energy-intensive organic fertilizers and bio-fertilizers. Fertilization and irrigation are key factors influencing environmental impacts, with fertilization affecting midpoint impacts and irrigation affecting endpoint impacts. Therefore, precision fertilization, efficient irrigation practices, and effective nutrient and soil moisture management are recommended to minimize environmental impacts. Subsequent studies could explore whether similar patterns are observed in different geographic regions and evaluate additional social and economic aspects of cotton sustainability beyond environmental impacts. Future agricultural LCAs should use both mass-based and area-based functional units to capture a broader range of environmental effects and evaluate the co-benefits and trade-offs between organic and conventional practices. © 2024 by the authors.", conventional farming; cotton farming; cradle-to-farm gate; Egypt; energy input–output; environmental impacts; farm optimization; life cycle assessment (LCA); organic farming; sustainability,0.0
568,Cumulative collision risk and population-level consequences of industrial wind-power plant development for two vulture species: A quantitative warning,"Prioritizing renewable energy generation over the conservation of natural habitats and species on a large spatial scale, leads to the paradox of impacting biodiversity to mitigate climate change. In this study, we aim at quantifying the long-term demographic impact of the excess mortality caused by collisions with wind turbines on the populations of two vulture species of conservation concern. Using long-term monitoring data and Integrated Population Models (IPMs), we quantified demographic parameters and projected population trends under various wind power development scenarios. Our findings indicate that even under our most optimistic scenarios, annual collision mortality could reach up to 30 % of the current Cinereous vulture population and 7 % of the Griffon vulture population. Without further wind power expansion, both vulture populations are predicted to remain stable or increase over the next 20 years. However, the addition of 85 wind turbines is likely to drive the Cinereous vulture to local extinction within 18 years and significantly slow the growth of the Griffon vulture population. Scenarios involving larger numbers of turbines could result in the extinction of both species within two to five years for Cinereous vultures and up to 20 years for Griffon vultures, depending on space use intensity. Our results underscore the vulnerability of long-lived species to excess mortality and highlight the need for comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) that incorporate population dynamics analyses. Effective conservation strategies must include rigorous pre- and post-construction monitoring, the availability of monitoring data, and cumulative impact assessments that consider the entire foraging range of these species. Additionally, strategic planning to avoid critical vulture habitats and implementing mitigation measures in buffer zones are essential. This study emphasizes the necessity of integrating biodiversity considerations into renewable energy planning to balance the goals of energy production and wildlife conservation. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.", Collision mortality; Integrated population models; Spatial planning; Wildlife management; Wind energy,1.0

The relationship between the quantified impact levels and the plant scale factors of BeiTou, LiZe, BaLi, LuTsao, RenWu, PingTung, SiJhou and HsinChu were constructed, and the impact levels of the GangShan (GS) and YongKong (YK) plants were predicted using grey model GM (1, N). Finally, the effects of plant scale factors on impact levels were evaluated using grey model GM (1, N) too. According to the predicted results of GM, the relative errors of topography/geology/soil, air quality, hydrology/water quality, solid waste, noise, terrestrial fauna/flora, aquatic fauna/flora and traffic in the GS plant were 17%, 14%, 15%, 17%, 75%, 16%, 13%, and 37%, respectively.

Various approaches for integrating BIM software and life cycle assessment (LCA) tools have been developed in recent years. However, limited research has been conducted in defining appropriate BIM-LCA integration approaches for embodied environmental impact assessment. To address this issue, this research develops a way of selecting the optimal BIM-LCA integration approach that incorporates the needs of different scenarios for the performance of the integration approach. Three scenarios of environmental impact assessment are designed to demonstrate the application of the proposed way, including 1) environmental impact assessment in early design stage, 2) environmental impact assessment in the detailed design stage, and 3) environmental impact assessment in construction design stage. The demonstration results indicate that the method of “using visual programming languages” is the optimal BIM-LCA integration approach for assessing environmental impacts in the early and construction design stages. The methods of “adopting LCA plugin for BIM-software” and “using visual programming languages” are the optimal approaches for environmental assessment in the scenario of detailed design stages. This research assists LCA practitioners in selecting optimal BIM-LCA integration approaches in different scenarios and further promotes the applications of BIM-LCA integration approaches during the whole design process of a building. © 2022", BIM; Environmental impact assessment; Integration; LCA; Optimal selection,0.0
577,"Long-term habitat loss in a lightly-disturbed population of the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis","Coastal and estuarine waters are important ecosystems with high primary and secondary productivity, but they are prone to the impacts of habitat loss caused by anthropogenic activities. For species exclusively inhabiting coastal and estuarine waters, such as the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, Sousa chinensis, irreversible habitat loss can have dramatic implications for population viability. A Landsat image database was used to determine the extent of coastal changes along the northern Beibu Gulf, where a large humpback dolphin population is found. The results were compared with the standardized sighting gradient (SPUF) determined from a questionnaire survey of fishermen and likely core habitats identified by application of a global digital elevation model. Both SPUF and likely core habitat results indicated a continuous distribution of the humpback dolphin along the northern Beibu Gulf. Landsat images revealed that 129.6 km2 of coastal waters were permanently lost in the past 40 years, 60 km2 within the likely core habitats. Although this may be considered small, the impact of such habitat loss could be substantial in some local habitats. The humpback dolphin population in the northern Beibu Gulf should be regarded as one management unit, with two or more social subunits. Immediate systematic surveys are needed to fill information gaps on true distribution range and habitat-use patterns.

578,"The formulation and evaluation of transport route planning alternatives: a spatial decision support system for the Via Baltica project, Poland","Transport planning plays an undeniably key role in the economic growth of any region. However, when done heedlessly this planning can be detrimental to the biophysical and social environment of the region. In transport route planning generally one or a few alternative routes are proposed, usually representing the interest of the proponent. If required, an environmental impact assessment is carried out on these alternatives. Although, EIA and SEA are meant to be effective in taking informed decisions about the proposed route, these alternatives - the heart of impact assessment - are themselves devised in a subjective and non-spatial manner. Such an approach may easily overlook routes, which could otherwise have been more suitable. A planning system that directly takes into account environmental and socio-economic considerations in selecting alternative routes facilitates sustainable development. This paper presents a holistic and coherent spatial multi-criteria network analysis method for the generation of optimal routing alternatives under different policy visions, in a network of existing roads. The presented methodology was case-tested for the highly contested 340 km portion of the Via Baltica corridor in Poland, a part of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) program. The methodology shows its ability to serve as a versatile effect-based decision support system for transport route planning at a strategically higher level of planning, particularly for (geographically) large-scale investment schemes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

579,Environmental assessment in cameroon: State of the art,"This paper is a summary of the evolution of the legal and institutionalframework and the practice of environmental assessment (EA) in Cameroon. A Ministry of Environment and Forestry was created in April 1992 with a mandate to elaborate, implement and follow up the national policy of environment; a master law August 1996 related to environmental management prescribes environmental impact assessment for all projects that can cause environmental degradation. However, this legal and institutional framework is yet to be effective. To achieve this, the existing framework should be completed by application instruments. Also the existing structures of authority should be provided with adequate human, financial and equipment resources. Based on two practical examples, the limitations of the present situation are highlighted, and some suggestions for improvement are made. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", Cameroon; Environmental assessment,1.0
580,Traffic pollution: Control policy and research trend,"This paper focuses on the control policies and countermeasures to prevent traffic pollution, and researches to enforce them. Traffic pollution, such as air pollution and road traffic noise caused by motor vehicles, continues to be one of the most serious and complicated environmental problems in major urban areas, and will remain so in the ""Network Society"" projected into the year 2000. The first step of regulating emission from vehicles, which depends on technical availability, halfway succeeded, and the second step directed towards reduction of friction between traffic and residences in respective areas by means of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIS) and improvement of road structure and roadside environment is in progress. While the effectiveness of those countermeasures reached the plateau, a wave of urbanization and motorization overwhelmed and cancelled them. This lead to the third step of a more comprehensive planning policy cooperating with transportation and urban management. The fourth policy expected is an economic incentive policy, such as road pricing, that takes the place of conventional regulatory countermeasures. © 1989.", ,1.0

The purpose of this paper is to analyze the environmental licensing of three highways in the Legal Amazon: BR-429/RO, BR-242/TO and BR-163/MT. The method adopted is documentary research with data from environmental licensing processes for three highways carried out by the National Department of Transport Infrastructure (NDTI). The environmental licensing processes analyzed are the responsibility of three different environmental agencies, one in the federal area, IBAMA, BR-242/TO, and the other two in the state sphere, BR-429/RO and BR-163/MT. The results observed are the disregard of important environmental impacts and the resizing of the impacts magnitude throughout the licensing process. The disregard of environmental impacts, as well as its resizing throughout the environmental licensing process, can lead to legal uncertainty and damage to the environment. These results support the improvement of environmental studies, with more effective monitoring and inspection by responsible agencies, stimulating institutional strengthening and the development of the EIA. © 2023, Reativar Ambiental.

582,Wind Power Compensation is not for the Birds: An Opinion from an Environmental Economist,"This article advocates for better implementation of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) framework as applied to wind power development, with a particular focus on improving compensatory restoration scaling. If properly enforced, the environmental impacts hierarchy ""avoid-minimize-compensate"" provides the regulated community with incentives to prevent wildlife and habitat impacts in sensitive areas and, if necessary, compensate for residual impacts through restoration or conservation projects. Given the increase in legislation requiring resource-based environmental compensation, methods for scaling an appropriate quantity and quality of resources are of increasing relevance. I argue that Equivalency Analysis (EA) represents a transparent and quantitative approach for scaling compensation in the case of wind power development. Herein, I identify the economic underpinnings of environmental compensation legislation and identify weaknesses in current scaling approaches within wind power development. I demonstrate how the recently completed REMEDE toolkit, which provides guidance on EA, can inform an improved scaling approach and summarize a case study involving raptor collisions with turbines that illustrates the EA approach. Finally, I stress the need for further contributions from the field of restoration ecology. The success of ex ante compensation in internalizing the environmental costs of wind development depends on the effective implementation of the environmental impacts hierarchy, which must effectively encourage avoidance and minimization over environmental restoration and repair. © 2011 Society for Ecological Restoration International.", Compensatory mitigation; Compensatory restoration; EIA; No net loss; Restoration scaling,1.0
583,Maintenance-based strategies for environmental risk minimization in the process industries,"Industry, environmental agencies and the scientific community have all emphasized the need to include environmental impact considerations next to profitability objectives in the design phase of modern chemical processes, responding to the increasing social concern over environmental degradation in the past years. Most environmental impact assessment and minimization approaches, however, are rather qualitative, providing general guidelines. In this work, to overcome their limitations and rigorously represent the defining elements of environmental risk, i.e. the mechanism of occurrence of unexpected events usually related to equipment failure and the severity of their consequences, detailed process, reliability and maintenance characteristics are incorporated within a process optimization framework. The objective concerns the optimization of overall process performance defined as a system effectiveness vector characterized by both the environmental and the profitability functions of the system. Implementation of the framework on a process example identifies the optimal combination of process design and operation as well as preventive maintenance strategies that accomplish the conflicting environmental and profitability targets and quantifies the existing trade-offs between them.

584,Evaluation for coastal reclamation feasibility using a comprehensive hydrodynamic framework: A case study in Haizhou Bay,"Coastal reclamation (CR) is a prevailing approach to solve the contradiction between the land shortage and the growing demand of living space for human beings. In general, environmental impact assessment (EIA) focuses on evaluating the feasibility of individual coastal reclamation project (CRP). However, few studies have investigated the cumulative effect of multiple CRPs on surrounding environment. In this study, an integrated framework based on coastal hydrodynamics was established, and then applied to the feasibility evaluation of multiple CRPs for future coastal management in Haizhou Bay, China. The results indicated that three out of five reclamation projects were feasible and the remaining two were forbidden in the study area, whereas EIA approves of all the CRPs.

585,Investigation into Sustainable Application of Class C Fly Ash Layer in Flexible Pavement,"Global demand for power generation has had an immense impact on thermal power plants that has caused a problem with fly ash disposal. Unless utilized suitably, fly ash deposits turn valuable land into dumping grounds that pose a risk to the environment and human health. In this study, the effectiveness of Class C fly ash (CFA) incorporated in a flexible pavement was investigated, which was based on laboratory and field investigations along with an environmental impact assessment. The laboratory experimentation included durability and repeated load triaxial (RLT) tests and in the field, falling weight deflectometer (FWD) tests were conducted. The test sections with a fly ash layer and a control section were constructed in the field to assess the viability of construction and service life. For the fly ash layer, the back-calculated modulus values were 4.3 and 6.5 times greater than the base and subbase of the control section, respectively. The fly ash section exhibited a service life ratio (SLR) of 1.72 compared with the control section under standard loading conditions. The energy consumed, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced, and capital cost incurred in the construction of the fly ash section were reduced by 67%, 59%, and 25.7%, respectively, compared with the control section. The bulk application of fly ash was advantageous and sustainable due to better structural performance and a significantly reduced environmental impact compared with conventional base and subbase layers.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.", Environmental impact assessment; Falling weight deflectometer; Fly ash; Sustainability; Waste reutilization,0.0
586,Methodology for environmental assessment of proposed activity using risk analysis,"This study applies a process of detailed assessment to summarize the potential impact of a proposed construction or other activity on the environment before implementation of an investment plan. The aim of the study was to develop a general methodology for analysis and evaluation of environmental issues connected with planned activities and proposed projects (especially buildings and engineering constructions, required implementation of environmental impact assessment process) using a risk analysis method, thus enabling the best option among the proposed activities to be chosen. The methodology was developed for conditions in Slovakia but could be arranged for any other country considering national conditions, requirements, standards and legislative. Application of the developed methodology in environmental impact assessment could create preconditions for more effective implementation of the EIA process. This paper provides a framework for the risk analysis component of the scoping phase within the EIA process. The process outlined in this paper will assist with determination of an estimation of risks to environmental and health of proposed activities. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.", Environmental impact assessment; Optimal alternative; Risk analysis; Risk parameters,1.0

The 2400 MW power plant fueled by lignite located in Thailand is demonstrated in this study. Emissions of mercury from the coal-fired power plant are calculated under 3 major scenarios. The first scenario is the amount of mercury released under the existing operation of the power plant. Emission rate of mercury is calculated as 41 g/h which indicates a co-benefit of mercury removal from the installation of existing conventional air pollution treatment systems (electrostatic precipitator and wet flue gas desulfurization) as compare with the 2nd scenario of without equipping of air pollution control devices at the power plant (374 g/h of mercury emission). Adding controlling measures to existing operation of the power plant can lead to decreasing of mercury emissions at different levels. The relationship between changing of emissions affected to ambient air concentrations of mercury is evaluated using the CALPUFF air dispersion model. Results indicate small decreasing of predicted ambient concentrations after applying additional mercury control measures to the BAU of the power plant. This study reveals the co-benefit of existing air pollution treatment devices in controlling mercury emission. It also illustrates that the efficiency and appropriateness of current air pollution control system is in an optimal and acceptable levels in mercury control. Finding and methodology in this study can be used as a case study in quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness and appropriateness of environmental control mitigation measures added to the existing operations. It clearly illustrates the need to analyze the co-benefit of current air pollution control system towards the accomplishment on controlling emissions of other emerging air pollutants which will provide the best optimum air pollution control to the emission source. © 2020 The Author(s)", Air quality; Atmosphere modelling; Co-benefit; Coal combustion; Environmental assessment; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental science; iPOG; Mercury emission; Sustainable development,0.0
588,Scientific shortcomings in environmental impact statements internationally,"Governments around the world rely on environmental impact assessment (EIA) to understand the environmental risks of proposed developments. To examine the basis for these appraisals, we examine the output of EIA processes in jurisdictions within seven countries, focusing on scope (spatial and temporal), mitigation actions and whether impacts were identified as ‘significant’. We find that the number of impacts characterized as significant is generally low. While this finding may indicate that EIA is successful at promoting environmentally sustainable development, it may also indicate that the methods used to assess impact are biased against findings of significance. To explore the methods used, we investigate the EIA process leading to significance determination. We find that EIA reports could be more transparent with regard to the spatial scale they use to assess impacts to wildlife. We also find that few reports on mining projects consider temporal scales that are precautionary with regard to the effects of mines on water resources. Across our sample of reports, we find that few EIAs meaningfully consider the different ways that cumulative impacts can interact. Across countries, we find that proposed mitigation measures are often characterized as effective without transparent justification, and sometimes are described in ways that render the mitigation measure proposal ambiguous. Across the reports in our sample, professional judgement is overwhelmingly the determinant of impact significance, with little transparency around the reasoning process involved or input by stakeholders. We argue that the credibility and accuracy of the EIA process could be improved by adopting more rigorous assessment methodologies and empowering regulators to enforce their use.

589,Review of Indian studies on environmental impact assessment,"Environmental clearance in India is a legal instrument that determines potential environmental implication of organized projects in India. It entails an assessment of sensitive projects, focal points, and proposals that have potential and likely effects on social, environmental, and economic matters before they are commenced. The intended goal of this procedure is to detect negative effects on local societies, the environment in this case, so as to foster sustainable development. In India, environmental impact assessment (EIA) is governed by the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and EIA Notification, 2006, that outline how and what EIAs should be prepared for different projects. Subsequent research has been executed on various aspects of EIA in a bid to improve the utility of the assessment tool in the Indian environment. This article provides a rigorous synthesis of existing literature on the subject of EIA in the context of India. A total of 47 research papers related to the subject were retrieved and subjected to a rigorous analysis through the PRISMA method. The objectives of the research are (1) to assess existing literature for the effectiveness of EIA processes in different contexts and identify gaps or areas for improvement; (2) to compile and synthesize findings from various studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of EIA research in India; (3) to identify patterns and indicators across different studies; (4) to analyze the evolution of environmental policies related to EIA in India and assess their impact; and (5) to provide recommendations for future research directions, policy enhancements, and practical improvements in the EIA process in India based on the synthesized findings. These summaries the comprehensive characteristic of the EIA studies related to India that might be useful for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners engaged in environmental management and sustainable development interventions in India. © The Author(s) 2025.

590,Predicting on-site environmental impacts of municipal engineering works,"The research findings fill a gap in the body of knowledge by presenting an effective way to evaluate the significance of on-site environmental impacts of municipal engineering works prior to the construction stage. First, 42 on-site environmental impacts of municipal engineering works were identified by means of a process-oriented approach. Then, 46 indicators and their corresponding significance limits were determined on the basis of a statistical analysis of 25 new-build and remodelling municipal engineering projects. In order to ensure the objectivity of the assessment process, direct and indirect indicators were always based on quantitative data from the municipal engineering project documents. Finally, two case studies were analysed and found to illustrate the practical use of the proposed model. The model highlights the significant environmental impacts of a particular municipal engineering project prior to the construction stage. Consequently, preventive actions can be planned and implemented during on-site activities. The results of the model also allow a comparison of proposed municipal engineering projects and alternatives with respect to the overall on-site environmental impact and the absolute importance of a particular environmental aspect. These findings are useful within the framework of the environmental impact assessment process, as they help to improve the identification and evaluation of on-site environmental aspects of municipal engineering works. The findings may also be of use to construction companies that are willing to implement an environmental management system or simply wish to improve on-site environmental performance in municipal engineering projects. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.", Construction process; EIA; EMAS; Municipal engineering projects; On-site environmental impacts,1.0
591,Towards making EIA more human-centric: Demonstration in Nepal of a values crystallization approach to capture local shared values for scoping use,"Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) are a critical component of planning and decision-making processes before projects are conducted, because they are used to forecast and inform mitigation of potential impacts on the local community, including its social, physical, and natural environments. Current EIA processes predominantly focus on issues that can be directly measured using objective methods, with mostly tokenistic inadequate use of suites of qualitative methodologies needed for identification and documentation of issues relating to community shared values. On the other hand, protests and tensions are known to easily arise which are related to such human values-based issues not being addressed. In this pragmatic study, a method is demonstrated which can bridge this gap, by capturing local community shared values in a well-defined manner and short time. The approach, called WeValue InSitu, enables local communities to construct their own bespoke group shared values statements in a specialized crystallization process, with outputs which are well-articulated proto-indicators. In this study we compare the outputs from two existing scoping reports of EIA in Nepal with the outputs from the values crystallization approach which we conducted with ten groups in a village in Nepal, and show that the latter brings out many more, and more localised, shared values of the community, and additionally reveals underlying interrelationships between values, producing conceptual maps for planning effective mitigations. Future studies can investigate whether the achievements of this method offer any advantages to existing qualitative methods in improving EIA-SIA scoping, and/or whether the hegemony of objectivism of institutions and proponents is an unsurmountable barrier. © 2024", EIA; EIA scoping; Environmental planning and decision making; Human values; Nepal; Shared values; SIA,1.0

As LCA efficiency greatly depends on the life cycle inventory (LCI) data used, it is the purpose of the current research to present detailed structural steel LCI data and thus increase environmental benefits deriving from the effective use of LCA within construction. Hot-rolled structural steel members were chosen as the research starting point and the necessary information was provided by the leading structural steel manufacturer in Greece. Results include a list of environmental inputs and outputs, which can be used within relevant LCA studies and environmental impact assessment. Critical issues hindering the use of LCA were identified, along with the most environmentally damaging production stages and environmental categories mainly burdened.

593,Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA): An exploration of synergies through development of a Strategic Environmental Framework (SEF),"The synergies between Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) have often been debated. In the right context, SEA can contribute to the efficiency of the EIA process, for example, when informing the scoping stage of the EIA. It can also compensate for some of the EIAs shortcomings, particularly in the provision of an effective monitoring framework. This paper reports on the SEA carried out on a port and industrial zone master plan in Abu Dhabi, UAE. This assessment is unusual in so much as it is a SEA of a privately funded master plan; is one of the first to be carried out in the Middle East (therefore not subject to EU Directive 2001/42/EC); and has been followed directly by an EIA of the same development. As such it provided a unique chance to adapt the SEA process and fully exploit any possible synergies between the two environmental assessment processes. © 2007 WIT Press.", Environmental capacity; Environmental impact assessment; Equator principles; Master plan; Middle East; Planning; Strategic environmental assessment; Strategic environmental framework; Sustainability,1.0
594,Impacts of climate change on current and future invasion of Prosopis juliflora in Ethiopia: environmental and socio-economic implications,"Prosopis juliflora is a serious invader, causing great ecological and economic damage in Ethiopia. Thus, it is imperative to examine potential invasion dynamics of P. juliflora at national level under climate change scenario to better influence decision making processes on the management of this invasive species. We derived a consensus model from five modeling approaches to examine the current and future (2050 and 2070) climatic suitability for P. juliflora under two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in Ethiopia. Under the current climatic scenario, 94.8% of the country was non-suitable for P. juliflora establishment and invasion while 0.4% (4.56 million ha) was highly suitable. In 2050, highly suitable area for P. juliflora is expected to increase by 55.6% and 63.6%, while moderately suitable area is projected to increase by 33.3% and 42.9% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, respectively. Compared to the current climatic condition, in 2070, highly suitable area for the species is projected to increase by 73.3% (3.43 million ha) and 80.0% (3.65 million ha) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario, respectively. With the current cover, this invasive species had already caused significant impact on rangelands in many parts of the country. Its further expansion would worsen the problem, leading to great environmental and economic damage, thereby threatening the livelihood of the community. Negative environmental and economical impacts caused by the species will be high if preventive and effective management measures are not earnestly taken, and it becomes one of the major challenges for the 21st century pastoralism and their livelihoods. We recommend a national effort be organized towards combating P. juliflora expansion to new areas, especially in regions and protected area predicted as frontiers of potential expansion. © 2020; Climate suitability; Conservation planning; Environmental and economical impact, Ethiopia, Management of invasive species, Species distribution models; Climatology; Ecology; Environmental impact assessment; Geography; Plant biology, Environmental science © 2020", Climate suitability; Climatology; Conservation planning; Ecology; Environmental and economical impact; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental science; Ethiopia; Geography; Management of invasive species; Plant biology; Species distribution models,0.0

596,Evolution of environmental impact assessment in Poland: Problems and prospects,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) in Poland has a tradition extending back to the 1980s. The main incentives for its evolution were the need to achieve harmonization with the legal requirements of the European Union as well as other international conventions. The Polish EIA concept has changed substantially since 2000. At present, it is treated as a process consisting of specific stages (screening, scoping, and so on), in which public involvement constitutes an integral part.

597,Procedural effects of environment impact assessment on controlling natural disaster (landslides and flashflood) based on environmental degradation from development in Malaysia,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a preemptive tool used by engineers, environmental consultants and planners to avoid the most likely adverse consequences of development projects. As a planning tool, EIA should curb the harmful effects from all stages of a project lifecycle. Landslides and flash floods are the most common problems faced by Malaysians almost yearly due to rapid development, especially that involving modification of watercourses, clearing of land and projects on hill slopes. Despite such issues, existing legislation and new guidelines have been enacted by the Malaysian government and must be followed by any proposing project team before starting development projects. The Department may have accepted an EIA report of the project. Still, several developments may have neglected the guidelines, especially during construction involving earthworks and exposure of the surrounding environment, place and people to a high risk of disaster caused by mishaps and accidents. The incidence of landslides and flash floods as reported in newspapers, journals, reports and books since 1919 is explored in this study to determine the details of the losses and locations. Despite the enactment of the new EIA law, landslides and flash floods continue to occur. This situation justifies the need to revise the approach based on sizes and include other factors, namely, the risk indices for disaster to happen and the effectiveness of EIA in reducing disaster risks in projects. © 2021 International Journal of Environmental Science and Development.

598,The effectiveness of the mitigation hierarchy in environmental impact studies on marine ecosystems: A case study in France,"While the development of maritime economic activity is increasingly encouraged, the consideration of its impacts constitutes a real challenge. The limitations of the implementation of the mitigation hierarchy have been widely discussed in scientific literature, yet data on marine biodiversity offset practices remains scarce. In this study, we investigated the use of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) as suitable instruments to achieve the No Net Loss objective. Drawing on a French approach developed for the initial assessment of the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive, we examined the pressures and impacts related to various marine development projects and the effectiveness of the mitigation hierarchy in limiting these. An analysis of 55 recent French environmental impact studies showed that only 7% of the proposed measures had the aim of offsetting predicted degradation of sites of remarkable biodiversity. This can be partly explained by the lack of a clear definition of 'significant impact', which varies greatly depending on what is impacted, in turn allowing socio-economic activities to benefit more easily from offset. Furthermore, offsetting does not always constitute the final step of the mitigation hierarchy, highlighting the need to reinforce avoidance and reduction steps. Although we acknowledge the role of EIA in mitigating the negative impacts of development projects, synergies with other European marine environmental policies such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) and the Maritime Spatial Planning directive (MSP) should be developed in order to improve current practices. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.", Biodiversity offset; Environmental Impact Assessment; Marine ecosystems; Mitigation hierarchy,1.0
599,The challenge of implementing the European network of protected areas Natura 2000,"Established under the European Union (EU) Birds and Habitats Directives, Natura 2000 is one of the largest international networks of protected areas. With the spatial designation of sites by the EU member states almost finalized, the biggest challenge still lying ahead is the appropriate management of the sites. To evaluate the cross-scale functioning of Natura 2000 implementation, we analyzed 242 questionnaires completed by conservation scientists involved in the implementation of Natura 2000 in 24 EU member states. Respondents identified 7 key drivers of the quality of Natura 2000 implementation. Ordered in decreasing evaluation score, these drivers included: network design, use of external resources, legal frame, scientific input, procedural frame, social input, and national or local policy. Overall, conservation scientists were moderately satisfied with the implementation of Natura 2000. Tree modeling revealed that poor application of results of environmental impact assessments (EIA) was considered a major constraint. The main strengths of the network included the substantial increase of scientific knowledge of the sites, the contribution of nongovernmental organizations, the adequate network design in terms of area and representativeness, and the adequacy of the EU legal frame. The main weaknesses of Natura 2000 were the lack of political will from local and national governments toward effective implementation; the negative attitude of local stakeholders; the lack of background knowledge of local stakeholders, which prevented well-informed policy decisions; and the understaffing of Natura 2000 management authorities. Top suggestions to improve Natura 2000 implementation were increase public awareness, provide environmental education to local communities, involve high-quality conservation experts, strengthen quality control of EIA studies, and establish a specific Natura 2000 fund. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.", Conservation biologists; European Directives; Governance; Protected area management; Questionnaire; Transnational conservation,1.0

Through scrutinizing two SEA application cases of China's provincial level expressway infrastructure (PLEI) network plans, it is found that current SEA practice in expressway infrastructure planning field has a number of problems including: SEA practitioners do not fully understand the objective of SEA; its potential contributions to strategic planning and decision-making is extremely limited; the employed application procedure and prediction and assessment techniques are too simple to bring objective, unbiased and scientific results; and no alternative options are considered. All these problems directly lead to poor quality SEA and consequently weaken SEA's effectiveness. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.", China; Effectiveness; Procedure; Process; Road planning; SEA; Strategic environmental assessment; Sustainable development,1.0
601,Good practices in environmental studies for simplified environmental impact assessment process; [Boas práticas em estudos ambientais para processos simplificados de avaliação de impacto ambiental],"The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is internationally recognized for its role in preventing and reducing impacts arising from proposals for the implementation of companies and enterprises. However, EIA systems around the world have been questioned regarding the length of the procedures employed. Thus, there are proposals to simplify the procedures and/or complexity of the required environmental studies. In the specific case of simplified environmental studies, doubts remain about the relevance and quality of these documents as the only inputs in decision-making about the environmental feasibility of the proposed projects. Therefore, this article starts from the systematic literature review for proposing quality requirements for environmental studies in EIA processes, which are applied in the evaluation of the Preliminary Environmental Report (RAP) of a dam for water supply in the State of São Paulo (SP). This case turned out to be a document with some deficiencies that compromise the effectiveness of the EIA process. It concludes by the need to reafirm the mechanisms of public participation and the adoption of tools that contribute to a more objective assessment of the environmental studies presented, providing ways for environmental technicians and authorities to distinguish the information gaps resulting from the level of knowledge about the environment and intentional omissions. © 2020 Universidade Federal do Parana.

This paper describes an evaluation of EIA in Colombia, using the model and the control mechanisms proposed and applied in other countries by Christopher Wood and Ortolano. The evaluation criteria used are based on Principles of Environmental Impact Assessment Best Practice, such as effectiveness and control features, and they were contrasted with the opinions of a panel of Colombian EIA experts as a means of validating the results of the study. The results found that EIA regulations in Colombia were ineffective because of limited scope, inadequate administrative support and the inexistence of effective control mechanisms and public participation.

The impacts of an industrial area, construction of a road and a wind power generator were investigated using the Ecospace habitat capacity model. The short and long-term effects of these projects were analyzed, considering cumulative effects of habitat loss, noise and light pollution on the environment. By applying Ecospace two alternatives were explored for each proposed project, thereby identifying the strategy with least impact and also determining the environmental damage and how it can be compensated.This study demonstrates that the Ecopath approach is the number one tool for environmental management in the European Union, as it can deliver the results that are needed to meet all legal requirements and it is also able to solve 'on-going' problems, for example assessment of cumulative and in-combination effects, identification of effective mitigation measures and providing clear, objective conclusions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.", Ecospace; Environmental impact assessment; Industrial area; Natura 2000; Road; Wind turbine generator,1.0
604,An ex-post evaluation of environmental impact assessment in alberta: A case study of the oldman river dam,"Environmental impact assessment is one of the most visible and formal components of the decision-making process for development planning and resource management in Canada. This has led some researchers to recommend Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) as the basis for a more integrated approach to the planning, management and control of resource development. However, this must be questioned as a result of the two major disputes over the adequacy of, and jurisdiction for, EIA in Canada which this paper proposes to study. The Oldman Dam was chosen for this case study as it provides an important and current example of how the growing public concern with the environment, coupled with an increasing awareness of EIA and willingness to intervene, has brought to a head the continuing debate over how well EIA has performed as an instrument of public policy. This paper involves the application of policy research methodology to study the environmental assessment process followed in the case of the Oldman Dam. The adequacy of the process in dealing with environmental issues and participation, and the resulting implications for resource management and development are of particular concern. This paper provides a description of the issues that led to the controversy surrounding the Oldman River Dam project (including the interjurisdictional disputes over the application of environmental assessment legislation), and addresses the questions of effectiveness, efficiency and fairness, three criteria which have been identified as key to successful EIA, surrounding the application of EIA to the project. The paper concludes with a discussion of how to improve the EIA process, and observations on challenges for the future. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", ,1.0
605,Public participation and Environmental Impact Assessment in Mainland China and Taiwan: Political foundations of environmental management,"What role can public participation play in environmental management? Among major tools for environmental management, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been widely practised in many countries. Its effectiveness, however, varies depending on the extent to which transparency and public participation are incorporated in its process. In this article, we analyse the role of public participation in environmental management by examining the operation of EIAs in two polities, Mainland China and Taiwan. In both cases, a lack of transparency and public participation had severely limited the effectiveness of EIA during the initial years when it was first introduced. Both polities have attempted to address the respective limitations of their EIA systems, and both have made some progress while encountering problems inherent in their underlying political institutions. The two cases illustrate the dynamic connections between political institutions and environmental management in developing countries. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Ltd.", ,1.0
606,Innovative public participatory gis methodologies adopted to deal with the social impact assessment process challenges: A sri lankan experience,"Public participatory geographic information system (PPGIS) is a growing concept in many disciplines and is increasingly practiced in participatory approaches to national planning and development proposals. Social Impact Assessment (SIA) is a vital element in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which helps minimize impacts on local communities because of development projects and proposed mitigation measures. Both concepts require professional involvement with bottom-up approaches and innovative methods to identify societal concerns in relation to proposed development. Currently, use of a PPGIS application within an SIA is limited, yet use of these innovative approaches is vital to explore the strengths and weaknesses of assessment methodology and community impact. This paper presents challenges encountered in the process of conducting SIA in the Kalu Ganga reservoir project in the Matale District of Sri Lanka. The proposed Kalu Ganga reservoir development will force 613 families to relocate. The business district will be totally inundated. The project site is environmentally and culturally sensitive, for it still maintains its pristine surroundings and the long-term impact on the area is unknown. As a result, the assessment team faced severe challenges from the local communities, including: (1) obstacles to carrying out the SIA because of strong resistance against construction of the reservoir; (2) difficulties of recording sensitive cultural and social aspects of the community; and (3) limited opportunities for integrating local and expert knowledge for effective decision making. In this paper, we will discuss the innovative, bottom-up PPGIS methodologies adopted to deal with the SIA process challenges. PPGIS integrates a variety of geospatial technologies and various traditional participatory research methods to represent people's concerns over development proposals and advocacy. In this reservoir project, PPGIS methodologies have helped developers, policy planners, and stakeholders to appreciate the project issues and incorporate them in the decision making. By bridging the strengths of PPGIS within SIA, we suggest that PPGIS techniques and procedures have great potential to enhance public policy and community engagement in development proposals.", ,1.0
607,Overall life cycle comprehensive assessment of pneumatic and electric actuator,"Pneumatic actuators and electric actuators have almost been applied to all manufacturing industries. The two kinds of actuators can replace each other in most fields, such as the point to point transmission occasion and some rotating occasions. However, there are very few research results about the advantages and disadvantages of two kinds of actuators under the same working conditions so far. In this paper, a novel comprehensive assessment method, named as overall life cycle comprehensive assessment (OLCCA), is proposed for comparison and assessment of pneumatic and electric actuators. OLCCA contains mechanical properties evaluation (MPE), life cycle cost analysis based on users (LCCABOU) and life cycle environmental impact analysis (LCEIA) algorithm in order to solve three difficult problems: mechanical properties assessment, cost analysis and environmental impact assessment about actuators. The mechanical properties evaluation of actuators is a multi-objective optimization problem. The fuzzy data quantification and information entropy methods are combined to establish MPE algorithm of actuators. Two kinds of pneumatic actuators and electric actuators with similar bearing capacity and similar work stroke were taken for example to verify the correctness of MPE algorithm. The case study of MPE algorithm for actuators verified its correctness. LCCABOU for actuators is also set up. Considering cost complex structure of pneumatic actuators, public device cost even method (PDCEM) is firstly presented to solve cost division of public devices such as compressors, aftercooler, receivers, etc. LCCABOU method is also effective and verified by the three groups of pneumatic actuators and electric actuators. Finally, LCEIA model of actuators is established for the environmental impact assessment of actuators. LCEIA data collection method and model establishment procedure for actuators are also put forward. With Simapro 7, LCEIA comparison results of six actuators can be obtained: Fossil fuels are the major environmental factor of pneumatic and electric actuators; Environmental impact of electric actuator is large than one of pneumatic actuator under the similar mechanical properties and working conditions of pneumatic and electric actuators. The results are correct and correspond with the actual mechanical properties of actuators. This paper proposes a comprehensive evaluation method of the actuators, which can solve the critical problem that similar electromechanical products are very difficult to be compared with each other from the angle of performance, cost and environment impact. © Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.", Actuator; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Mechanical properties evaluation; Public device cost even method,0.0
608,Risk assessment for improved treatment of health considerations in EIA,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Risk Assessment (RA) processes are rarely used to complement each other despite potential benefits of such integration. This paper proposes a model for procedural and methodological integration of EIA and RA based on reported best practice approaches. The proposed model stipulates 'embedding' RA into EIA and is organized in accordance with the generic stages of the EIA process. The model forms the basis for the proposed Evaluation Package which can be used as a benchmarking tool for evaluating the effectiveness of integration of RA within particular EIAs. The current paper uses the package for evaluating seven Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) of waste incineration facilities in the UK produced between 1990 and 2000. Though RA was found to be an element of these EIAs, its prominence varied considerably from case to case. Systematic application of RA in accordance with the best practice was not observed. Particular omissions were demonstrated in assessing health impacts not directly associated with air emissions, identifying the receptors of health impacts (affected population), interpreting health impacts as health risks, dealing with uncertainties, and risk communications. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The influence of social, economic and ecological environment in the overall land planning was analysed to build the environmental impact index system of the overall land planning. GRNN was used to screen the indexes with different degrees of influence, MIV was introduced to screen the index values, and rank correlation coefficient among the indexes was controlled. The indexes obtained after screening were input into BP artificial neural network to build an environmental impact assessment model of overall land planning. The experimental show that the mean absolute error is about 1.6%, and minimum root-mean-square error is about 0.01.

613,Suggestions for integrating EIA and economic development in the Caribbean region,"Conflicts between economic development and fragile natural resources represent a growing problem among the islands of the Caribbean. Relatively simple methods exist to incorporate environmental impact assessment (EIA) into development planning and review. These methods can save scarce financial resources for island nations, increase their control over the development process, and possibly forestall widespread environmental deterioration and its attendant public cost. Island nations have more power as negotiating partners in the development process than is generally realized. This power can be exercised if EIA is integrated into the national planning process, giving ministries a stronger bargaining position when negotiating with development interests. This paper begins with a discussion of the most prevalent environmental concerns in the region, including oil development, water supply, beach erosion and fisheries depletion, and proceeds to discuss practical solutions to improve local control over economic development and environmental resource management. A hypothetical case study is used to illustrate major obstacles to effective integration of economic development and EIA. Recommendations are included to advance the state-of-the-art of EIA using joint fact-finding, expanding participation in EIA, evaluating cumulative impacts and project alternatives, and conducting post-projecting monitoring. © 1988.", ,1.0
614,Forecasting river water temperature time series using a wavelet–neural network hybrid modelling approach,"Accurate and reliable water temperature forecasting models can help in environmental impact assessment as well as in effective fisheries management in river systems. In this paper, a hybrid model that couples discrete wavelet transforms (WT) and artificial neural networks (ANN) is proposed for forecasting water temperature. Four mother wavelets, including Daubechies, Symlet, discrete Meyer and Haar, are considered to develop the WT-ANN hybrid model. The hybrid model is applied to forecast daily water temperature on the Warta River in Poland. Time series of daily water temperatures in eight river gauges as well as daily air temperatures of seven meteorological stations are used for forecasting daily water temperature. The performance of this WT-ANN hybrid model is evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained from linear and non-linear regression models as well as a traditional ANN model. The results show that the WT-ANN models perform well in simulating and forecasting river water temperature time series, and outperform the linear, non-linear and traditional ANN models. The superior performance of the WT-ANN models is particularly observed for extreme weather conditions, such as heat waves and drought. Among the four mother wavelets applied, the discrete Meyer performs the best, slightly better than the Daubechies at level 10 and Symlet, while the Haar mother wavelet has the lowest accuracy. In addition, the model performance improves with an increase in the decomposition level, indicating the importance of the choice of decomposition level. The outcomes of this study have important implications for water temperature forecasting and ecosystem management of rivers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.", Artificial neural networks; Regression model; Warta River; Water temperature forecasting; Wavelet transform,0.0
615,Improving environmental impact assessment (EIA) process in Malaysia,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a planning tool to identify, predict and evaluate potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures in the early stages of proposed projects. Although EIA has been implemented in Malaysia for over 25 years, the EIA practices have yet to achieve the parameters of effective environmental management and sustainable development. Hence, this research aims to improve the EIA process in Malaysia. Three objectives were utilised in this research which are to recognise the fundamentals of EIA process and procedures applied in Malaysia, to analyse the issues in relation to the EIA preparation and submission conducted in Malaysia and to propose a set of recommendations to further improve the current EIA process in Malaysia. Mixed methods approach was embarked composed of qualitative instruments via document review and semi-structured interviews and quantitative instrument utilising questionnaire survey. Key issues on the EIA process in Malaysia were gathered from qualitative data collected. Analysis of data collected resulted to recommendations on the key issues regarding EIA. 25 proposed recommendations to improve the EIA process were contextualised and validated via questionnaire survey. Ergo, this research established an improved EIA process in Malaysia towards sustainable development to ameliorate the EIA practices in Malaysia. © 2016 Penerbit UTM Press.

616,An evaluation of ecological impact assessment procedural effectiveness over time,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is an important tool to help decision-makers balance the environmental impacts of a proposed built development with its potential economic benefits. Used in most countries across the globe, EIA commonly includes an ecological component (Ecological Impact Assessment, or EcIA). However, despite considerable changes in relevant legislation, policy and guidance, there has been no recent review of UK EcIA chapter content, with the latest review having been published in 2000. This study attempts to determine the procedural effectiveness of EcIA chapters over time by comparing a new review of 112 English EcIA chapters from 2000 onwards with earlier reviews. This was achieved through the novel use of inferential statistics, an approach previously lacking in the EIA and EcIA review literature. The limitations and advantages of the use of quantitative methods are discussed. In general, there has been an improvement in the information content of EcIA chapters over time, for example in the percentage of EcIA chapters stating the size of the development and estimating the likely effectiveness of proposed mitigation measures. However, the earlier reviews highlighted such severe information deficiencies that the progress seen in the post-2000 EcIA chapter review still leaves considerable scope for improvement. Changes in the EU's EIA Directive in force since May 2014 (and to be transposed into Member State legislation by May 2017) have the potential to encourage the use of inferential statistics in EIA and EcIA review: the requirement for Member States to provide central access to EIA information should enable representative samples to be analysed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd", Biodiversity; Ecology; EIA; Environmental statement; Impact assessment; Review,1.0
617,Relevant dimensions for proactive environmental assessment of urban mobility; [Dimensiones relevantes para la evaluación ambiental proactiva de la movilidad urbana],"A reduction of negative environmental impacts in urban transportation (air pollution, energy consumption, etc.) is thought to be crucial in promoting sustainable development outcomes in cities, however evidence shows that this objective is hardly achieved in practice. In the case of urban transport planning, the transition to sustainability requests that its performance must be assessed. This has originated important challenges for the academia in providing efficient assessment tools. As a response to these challenges, sustainability assessment has become a rapidly developing area associated with the family of impact assessment tools ((e.g. Environmental Impact Assessment and Strategic Environmental Assessment). In recent years, many countries have conferred to sustainability assessment, and specifically to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), an important and decisive role into their planning systems. The effectiveness of the traditional methods for evaluating urban transport plans/interventions (e.g. EIA, EAE, Cost-Benefit Analysis) is contested as strongly argued by several academics. A key problem is that these methods currently focus too much on identifying environmental impacts that might happen rather than on finding ways of preventing them from happening. They are used reactively rather than proactively. Underlying this is the belief that traditional evaluation methods have difficulty guiding improvements in urban transport plans and projects in decision-making and their capacity to support technical decisions becomes limited. First, this is a consequence of the fact that the environmental assessment (EA) process mainly includes EA-makers and they are not integrated enough in the transport planning process. Second, the used methods not always are the most suitable to identify ways of preventing potential impacts with respect to the particular nature of urban transportation. In seeking to answer these problems, the paper presents a strategy for proactive environmental instruments design. Accordingly to this strategy, EA instruments must fulfil two key criteria: i) be spatial integration-oriented; ii) be performance and threshold-based. The strategy is presented here as a complementary vision to traditional instruments. To illustrate and assess the worth of this strategy, the Environmental Thresholds Values Model ('ETV-model') was developed following these criteria and applied to evaluate alternative plans for a transit corridor in the city of Granada, Spain. This Spanish case is very illustrative of the described problems. The development of ETV-Model and its application to MAG permitted to test the proactive dimension of the EA process with respect to: i) interaction level between EA-makers and transport planners; ii) the Abstraction level of the EA process with respect to traditional EA instruments; iii) the Role of the EA in urban transport planning; The reduction of abstraction level from the evaluation was a highlighted aspect to foster a more holistic dimension during the process. This meant to develop an integrated conceptual framework between the EA-makers and transport planners. The identification of 'mobility environments' in the first stage of the 'ETV-model' was very significant in this respect. Under these geographical units, the involved practitioners not only established the first criteria for the evaluation, but prescriptions on the final design of alternatives were emitted by EA-makers taking into account these spatial references. The estimation of an aggregated environmental performance value was considered by transport planners as an excellent way to obtain comprehensive conclusions, as well as, the adoption of reference values facilitated the understanding of specific environmental problems of alternatives between the two focus groups. Another highlighted aspect during the application of the 'ETV-Model' was the fact that the evaluation had a central role not only during the selection of alternatives, but also to modify the alternative selected in the last phase of the evaluation process. Since the earliest, the outcomes of the model reflected in general that Alternative S.1 had less environmental negative impact than Alternative S.0, although this statement was dependent on the 'mobility environment' considered. During the application of the ETV-model the outcomes were related to dynamics characteristics of urban transportation, covering different temporal periods and including the interaction between EA-makers and transport planners in different workshops/meetings. After analysing the two possible alternatives the decision module of ETV-model through the indicators 'Absorption capacity' and 'Improvement capacity' assessed possible changes to optimize the alternative selected (alternative S.1). The outcomes obtained oriented transport planners to modify the alternative with respect to the number of lines of public transport in the case of 'motorized traffic environment' and 'local and circulation environment', as well as, the walkable areas in the case of 'Local oriented environment'. © 2015, Instituto de Geografia.

618,Actors' perceptions of environmental impact assessment (EIA) benefits to fulfil Sweden's national environmental objectives,"Activities that require a permit in Sweden account for a significant part of the environmental impact that jeopardizes the fulfilment of the 16 Swedish National Environmental Quality Objectives (EQOs) set up by the Swedish Parliament. In this study we investigate how the EQOs are perceived as a management tool in the Swedish Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process, mainly based on interviews. We have identified several limitations associated with the use of EQOs in EIAs as an effective management tool towards sustainability. These limitations include that the EQOs have a subordinate significance compared with other aspects in the EIA process and that EQOs represent different concepts of sustainability. Furthermore, EQOs have low validity and are set as national objectives, hence separated from the operational level of EIAs. A significant proportion of environmental pressures leading to failure to achieve the EQOs are related to permit requiring activities, hence EIA and the permitting process can be important policy instruments to achieve the Swedish EQOs. Integrating EQOs better into EIAs may facilitate handling of synergies, inconsistencies, and trade-offs between environmental and sectoral objectives. Furthermore, driving forces of environmental problems may be targeted more directly. However, in order for the Swedish EQOs to have a larger impact in the permitting process, the EQO system may need to be adapted, and may also need to be complemented with binding standards or legal norms. Furthermore, clearer guidelines regarding issues to focus on, and necessary templates and documentation may be useful tools to facilitate the process even further. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.", Environmental impact assessment; Environmental objectives; Environmental quality objectives; Management by objectives; Sweden,1.0
619,Ratchet effects revisited: power effects and systematic bias in natural resource management,"Regulatory ratchets arise when governance appears to be effective, but actually masks a steady loss of natural capital. This occurs when biases in environmental impact assessment (EIA) systematically underestimate the true impact of large developments, generated by statistical convention fixing α at 0.05 (Type 1 error or false positive rate; i.e., the probability of concluding that a development will have an impact when there is none) while β, the false negative rate (failing to detect a true impact, or Type 2 error), is often fixed at 0.2. This asymmetry (β > α) generates a higher likelihood of mistakenly permitting development than mistakenly preventing it. Beyond statistical bias in EIA, routine environmental regulations are often ineffective due to low compliance, inadequate thresholds, and broad exemptions, which tend to cryptically institutionalize net loss. Measuring bias and inefficiency of environmental regulation is foundational to correcting regulatory ratchets and identifying pathways towards no net loss. Like net loss from major developments, cumulative net loss from inadequate routine environmental protections also needs to be estimated and offset by active habitat restoration; this should be delivered as a core program of resource management agencies, with the goal of fully integrating the mitigation hierarchy into routine natural resource governance. © 2025 The Author.", bias; cumulative effects; environmenregulation; environmental impact assessment; power effects; Type 1 and Type 2 error,1.0
620,Ethical implications of democratic theory for U.S. public participation in environmental impact assessment,"Traditional mechanisms for public participation in environmental impact assessment under U.S. federal law have been criticized as ineffective and unable to resolve conflict. As these mechanisms are modified and new approaches developed, we argue that participation should be designed and evaluated not only on practical grounds of cost-effectiveness and efficiency, but also on ethical grounds based on democratic ideals. In this paper, we review and synthesize modern democratic theory to develop and justify four ethical principles for public participation: equal opportunity to participate, equal access to information, genuine deliberation, and shared commitment. We then explore several tensions that are inherent in applying these ethical principles to public participation in EIA. We next examine traditional NEPA processes and newer collaborative approaches in light of these principles. Finally, we explore the circumstances that argue for more in-depth participatory processes. While improved EIA participatory processes do not guarantee improved outcomes in environmental management, processes informed by these four ethical principles derived from democratic theory may lead to increased public engagement and satisfaction with government agency decisions. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.", Collaboration; Democratic theory; Ethics; NEPA; Public participation,1.0
621,Environmental benefits of ozonated water for sustainable grapevine disease control: A life cycle and carbon sequestration analysis,"The oxidative capacity of ozone makes it a highly effective biocide, widely used in the food and processing industry, as well as in drinking water plants. In a context of tighter restrictions on the use of synthetic plant protection products at the regulatory level, wineries are looking for alternative methods to control diseases, making the application of ozonated water an option to consider. To determine the environmental sustainability of this alternative vineyard disease control treatment, an environmental impact assessment was conducted using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The assessment was carried out in a vineyard located in the D.O. Rías Baixas of Galicia, located in northwestern Spain. The analysis was conducted on the basis of two functional units: i) 1 kg of grapes and ii) 1 ha of land managed and using a cradle-to-gate boundary system. Ten impact categories were assessed using the ReCiPe method, except for the water scarcity indicator, which was quantified using AWARE. The environmental sustainability of the vineyard was further analyzed by measuring its carbon sequestration potential to obtain a more complete environmental profile. The RothC-26.3 model was chosen to estimate absolute carbon sequestration and annual sequestration rate from 2020 to 2040. Since the ozone-only scenarios lost all harvest, no environmental assessment was performed for such scenarios. For the remaining scenarios, the findings suggest that those using a combination of ozonated water and fungicides have the worst environmental performance due to notable reductions in grape yield and more frequent disease control interventions, particularly in certain scenarios. When evaluating environmental performance per hectare of land managed, the scenario using ozonated water with a limited number of disease control interventions exhibited the most favorable environmental profile, primarily due to reduced use of fungicides and disease control passes. In addition, the main contributors to the vineyard environmental profile identified were diesel fuel combustion during field operations, fertilizer use and production, and irrigation. In addition, the research indicates that the vineyard sequesters carbon annually, but this alone is insufficient to offset its greenhouse gas emissions. However, it is estimated that through the application of more appropriate soil management practices, the vineyard could achieve carbon neutrality and potentially increase soil carbon stocks over time. © 2024 The Authors", Biodiversity; Carrying capacity; Ecosystem services; Soil organic carbon; Sustainability metric; Wine,0.0
622,Project justification and EIA: Anything goes?,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) incorporates environmental aspects into decision-making, but sometimes it is not effective in rejecting projects with dubious justification, significant impacts and little social utility, especially when they have political support. EIA is expected to achieve sustainable development, but without calling development into question; however, it should be able to ask the question of whether development is really necessary. Although EIA is political, as a part of the decision-making process, politicization must be limited to prevent it from becoming a mere instrument for giving an “environmental veneer” to development. Some measures thar can help avoid unjustified projects are: adopting administrative justice approach to EIA; minimising politicization of EIA agencies; improving transparency in decision-making and proportionality of EIA procedures; carrying out pre-feasibility studies; increasing the scope of SEA; allowing more than one SEA or EIA procedure for the same development throughout the planning process; strengthening the justification of the project in EIA documents; or making the scoping phase mandatory at least for major projects. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.", Environmental impact assessment; Political pressures; Significant impacts; Unjustified projects,1.0
623,Enhancing Hong Kong's climate resilience: Integrating climate change into environmental impact assessment,"Hong Kong's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) system currently faces challenges in adequately addressing the pressing issue of climate change, as evidenced by recent extreme weather events. This viewpoint article argues for an urgent reform of Hong Kong's EIA framework, drawing upon a systematic analysis of 76 EIA reports between 2015 and 2024, global best practices, and stakeholder perspectives. The suggested reforms include amending the EIA Ordinance to explicitly mandate climate change assessment, improving technical guidelines, and promoting a comprehensive, science-based, and participatory approach to integrating climate change considerations into EIAs. This article contributes to the ongoing discussion in Hong Kong on whether to incorporate climate change into the EIA system, providing evidence to support this issue and accelerate its entry into the realm of policy formulation and implementation. By implementing the suggested reforms, Hong Kong can transform its EIA system into an effective tool for climate-responsive decision-making and establish itself as a leader in sustainable urban development, providing a model for other coastal cities facing similar challenges in the context of climate change. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.", Climate change; Environmental Impact Assessment; Hong Kong; Resilience,1.0
624,"Environmental impact assessment using a utility-based recursive evidential reasoning approach for structural flood mitigation measures in Metro Manila, Philippines","In recent years, the practice of environmental impact assessment (EIA) has created significant awareness on the role of environmentally sound projects in sustainable development. In view of the recent studies on the effects of climate change, the Philippine government has given high priority to the construction of flood control structures to alleviate the destructive effects of unmitigated floods, especially in highly urbanized areas like Metro Manila. EIA thus, should be carefully and effectively carried out to maximize or optimize the potential benefits that can be derived from structural flood mitigation measures (SFMMs). A utility-based environmental assessment approach may significantly aid flood managers and decision-makers in planning for effective and environmentally sound SFMM projects. This study proposes a utility-based assessment approach using the rapid impact assessment matrix (RIAM) technique, coupled with the evidential reasoning approach, to rationally and systematically evaluate the ecological and socio-economic impacts of 4 planned SFMM projects (i.e. 2 river channel improvements and 2 new open channels) in Metro Manila. Results show that the overall environmental effects of each of the planned SFMM projects are positive, which indicate that the utility of the positive impacts would generally outweigh the negative impacts. The results also imply that the planned river channel improvements will yield higher environmental benefits over the planned open channels. This study was able to present a clear and rational approach in the examination of overall environmental effects of SFMMs, which provides valuable insights that can be used by decision-makers and policy makers to improve the EIA practice and evaluation of projects in the Philippines. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", EIA; Evidential reasoning; Metro Manila; Rapid impact assessment matrix; Structural flood mitigation measures,1.0
625,The environmental management of shipping,"The environmental management of shipping requires systematic consideration of the geography of shipping routes, ship types and cargoes, and environments which can form the basis of a classificatory approach to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Beyond this, effective environmental management depends in the first instance upon sound information management including monitoring of the environment, surveillance of shipping and information technology, followed by information assessment including, in particular, risk and environmental impact. The general management dimension includes co-ordination of technical management and organisational aspects related to shipping. It is suggested that effective environmental management of shipping may depend upon a regionalisation of the marine environment for EIA purposes akin to that found in the loadline rules, together with rationalisation of the increasing number of special areas in existence or proposed for this purpose. EIA will have to become an integral part of the overall management system in the shipping industry. © 1995.", ,0.0

However, hydropower induces significant environmental impacts on river ecosystems - impacts that are addressed through environmental impact assessment (EIA) processes. The need for effective EIA processes is increasing as environmental regulations are either stressed in developing countries undertaking rapid expansion of hydropower capacity or time- and resource-intensive in developed countries. Part of the challenge in implementing EIAs lies in reaching a consensus among stakeholders regarding the most important environmental factors as the focus of impact studies. To help address this gap, we developed a weight-of-evidence approach (and toolkit) as a preliminary and coarse assessment of the most relevant impacts of hydropower on primary components of the river ecosystem, as identified using river function indicators. Through a science-based questionnaire and predictive model, users identify which environmental indicators may be impacted during hydropower development as well as those indicators that have the highest levels of uncertainty and require further investigation. Furthermore, an assessment tool visualizes inter-dependent indicator relationships, which help formulate hypotheses about causal relationships explored through environmental studies. We apply these tools to four existing hydropower projects and one hypothetical new hydropower project of varying sizes and environmental contexts. We observed consistencies between the output of our tools and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission licensing process (inclusive of EIAs) but also important differences arising from holistic scientific evaluations (our toolkit) versus regulatory policies. The tools presented herein are aimed at increasing the efficiency of the EIA processes that engender environmental studies without loss of rigor or transparency of rationale necessary for understanding, considering, and mitigating the environmental consequences of hydropower. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd", Dams; Eco-evidence; Environmental indicators; River; Streams; Sustainability protocol,1.0
628,"The role of environmental impact assessment in protecting coastal and marine environments in rapidly developing islands: The case of Bahrain, Arabian Gulf","Bahrain, a group of islands, is facing several environmental challenges, including degradation of coastal and marine environments due to intensive dredging and reclamation activities. Presently, reclamation activities have resulted in adding around 110km2 representing an increase of 14% of the total land area of Bahrain. Recognizing the role of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in protecting environment from degradation and pollution associated with coastal developments, Bahrain formally adopted EIA in its environmental system in 1998. The present study investigated the practice and effectiveness of EIA in protecting coastal and marine environments in Bahrain by reviewing selected EIA reports and soliciting views of EIA experts, consultants, academics and other relevant bodies. Shortcomings in environmental and ecological assessment practices related to coastal and marine developments were recognized and constrains that restrict the effectiveness of EIA in protecting coastal and marine environments in Bahrain were identified. Maintaining a sustainable use of coastal and marine natural resources in Bahrain requires measures to holistically address the interactions among the several dredging and reclamation projects and their additive and cumulative impacts. This could be achieved through enhancing the current practice of EIA process and adopting Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) for dredging and reclamation activities. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.", Bahrain; Coastal development; Dredging; Environmental impact assessment; Reclamation,1.0

This study serves as a tool for limnological interpretation data and in environmental impact assessment due to the disposal of tailings from bauxite processing. Lake area, volume, shoreline length, maximum effective length and width, shoreline development, maximum, relative and mean depth, volume development and a hypsographic curve were calculated. The lake is submitted to a significant seasonal variation of its surface area and shoreline length.

630,Balancing between Two Extremes during Environmental Impact Assessment: a Case Study,"The paper examines how opposing interests (cost effectiveness versus environmental sustainability) are balanced during the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process. During an EIA study, it is the Environmental Specialist’s role to conduct an EIA and bridge the gap between the Proponent and Activists. This study involves the developmental impact of coal transportation through a mangrove forest, a sensitive ecosystem. There are three major areas of disagreement among the Proponent and Activist: (i) overall impact on Sundarbans Mangrove Reserve Forests (SMRF); (ii) impact of air emissions; and (iii) impacts due to coal shipment. Assessment showed air quality impacts would be within applicable standards and guidelines. There will be an increase in marine traffic due to coal transportation; however, if the recommended mitigation measures are followed, then the project will have a manageable and limited impact on the SMRF. There will be water quality degradation and coal dust accumulation in the riverbed at the coal trans-shipment point. An aquatic habitat of approximately 290 ha in size is recommended as compensation for degraded land in the study. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.", Air quality; CALPUFF; Coal transportation; Environmental impact assessment; Fugitive coal dust; Sundarbans,1.0
631,"Cultural influences on implementing environmental impact assessment: Insights from Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia","In Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia, political and business support for environmental impact assessment (EIA) is low, and environmental agencies are virtually powerless compared with economic development agencies. Western-style democratic principles are weakly supported, the public is effectively excluded from project planning and decision-making, mission agencies are relatively isolated from public demands for environmental protection, and environmental agencies have difficulty enforcing EIA requirements. Environmental advocacy is growing but is still new and largely unappreciated by government. Whereas technical factors contribute to the consequent ineffectiveness of EIA, cultural factors provide complementary explanations. A reliance on paternalistic authority, hierarchy, and status as principles of social organization; a dependence on patron-client relationships for ensuring loyalty and advancement among political, bureaucratic, and private-sector actors; and a strong desire to avoid conflict and maintain face all reinforce the power of political and business elites and circumscribe that of individuals and communities. They also result in government bureaucracies where low-status environment agencies have little power or authority and the interagency cooperation needed for effective EIA is lacking. The article demonstrates that it is vital to consider cultural as well as technical factors when examining the difficulties of implementing policies or programs like EIA, which are invented in the West and transferred to another culture with very different social and political heritages and practices.; In Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia, political and business support for environmental impact assessment (EIA) is low, and environmental agencies are virtually powerless compared with economic development agencies.

632,"Environ indicator sensitivity to flux uncertainty in a phosphorus model of Lake Sidney Lanier, USA","Effective environmental impact assessment and management requires improved understanding of the organization and transformation of ecosystems in which independent agents are linked through an intricate network of energy, matter, and informational interactions. While advances have been made, we still lack a complete understanding of the processes that create, constrain, and sustain ecosystems. Network environ analysis (NEA) provides one approach for building novel ecosystem insights, but it is model dependent. As ecological modeling is an imprecise art, often complicated by inadequate empirical data, the utility of NEA may be limited by model uncertainty. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of NEA indicators of ecosystem growth and development to flow and storage uncertainty in a phosphorus model of Lake Sidney Lanier, USA. The indicators are total system throughflow (TST), total system storage (TSS), total boundary input (Boundary), Finn cycling index (FCI), ratio of indirect-to-direct flows (Indirect/Direct), indirect flow index (IFI), network aggradation (AGG), network homogenization (HMG), and network amplification (AMP). Our results make two primary contributions. First, they demonstrate that five of the indicators - FCI, Indirect/Direct, IFI, AGG and HMG - are relatively robust to the flow and storage uncertainty in the Lake Lanier model. This stability lets us draw robust conclusions about the Lake Lanier ecosystem organization (e.g., phosphorus flux in the lake is dominated by internal processes) in spite of uncertainties in the model. Second, we show that the majority of the indicators co-vary and that most of their common variation could be mapped onto two latent factors, which we interpret as (1) system integration and (2) boundary influences. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

633,Optimizing taxonomic resolution and sampling effort to design cost-effective ecological models for environmental assessment,"Predictive models relating ecological assemblages to environmental conditions are widely used in environmental impact assessment and biomonitoring. Such models are often parameterized using comprehensive ecological sampling and taxonomic identification efforts. Limited resources mean that expensive sampling and analytical procedures should be planned to maximize information gain and minimize unnecessary expense. However, there has been little consideration of cost-effectiveness in parameterizing predictive models using ecological assemblages and no explicit consideration of cost-effectiveness in balancing investment in the crucial aspects of sample size and taxonomic resolution. Using lacustrine diatom (Bacillariophyceae) assemblages from four large-scale (c. 77 000-1·3 million km2) data sets containing between 207 and 493 lakes, we address the following questions: (1) how does taxonomic resolution affect information content; (2) how does sample size affect information content for different taxonomic resolutions; and (3) what are the most cost-effective strategies for constructing environmental assessment models using diatom assemblages across a range of budgets? We use weighted averaging regression models for pH, phosphorus, salinity and lake depth and realistic data collection costs to examine the relationship between cost and model information content (R2 and root mean squared error of prediction). For diatom-based models, finer taxonomic resolutions almost always provide more cost-effective information content than collecting more samples, with (morpho)species being the most appropriate taxonomic resolution for nearly all budget scenarios. Information content exhibits an asymptotic relationship with sample size and budget, with greatest information gain during initial sample size increases, and little gain beyond c. 100 samples. Smaller sample sizes can also achieve surprising predictive power in some cases, suggesting low-cost regional models may be achievable. However, caution is necessary in such an approach, because spatial dependencies in predictions may be missed and analogues with predicted assemblages may be poor. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate the utility of explicitly considering cost estimates to determine optimal sampling effort and taxonomic resolution for ecological assemblage models. For large, regional biomonitoring programmes, cost-effective sampling could save millions of dollars. Our framework for determining optimal trade-offs in ecological assemblage models is easily adaptable to other taxa and analytical techniques used in biomonitoring and environmental assessment.

634,"Remaining suitable areas for the critically endangered Brazilian Merganser (Mergus octosetaceus; Aves, Anseriformes) are threatened by hydroelectric power plants","The critically endangered Brazilian Merganser Mergus octosetaceus is one of the rarest waterfowls in the world. Only three isolated populations remain in the Brazilian Cerrado, totaling less than 250 individuals. We evaluated the potential influence of small hydroelectric plants (SHPs) and Protected Areas (PAs) on the species’ conservation. We identified suitable areas by using recent presence records and environmental predictors, and overlapped it with the species dispersion zone and the SHP impact zone. Suitable areas for the species are limited to 4% of the geographic space (142,899 km2). Within the dispersion zone, we found 36 planned SHPs, which can impact 4.1% of the suitable area and 17.2% of the suitable area inside PAs. Our results expose the critical situation of the Brazilian Merganser, with few isolated suitable areas, high potential impacts for the three known populations, and a high proportion of suitable areas out of PAs. We highlight the need of considering SHPs impacts on the Brazilian Merganser in environmental impact assessment studies to reduce them. Furthermore, we appointed areas for search of new populations, and emphasize how urgent the implementation of effective conservation actions aiming to protect the remaining suitable habitats for the Brazilian Merganser is. © 2021", Dam; Maxent; Mergini; Small hydroelectric plant; Species distribution model; Waterfowl,1.0
635,The consideration of health in strategic environmental assessment (SEA),"Following the requirements of the European Directive 2001/42/EC on strategic environmental assessment (SEA) and the Protocol on Strategic Environmental Assessment (Kiev, 2003) to the Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context (Espoo, 1991), health is one of the aspects to be considered in SEA. In this paper, results of an evaluation of eight SEAs from Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (England and Wales) regarding the consideration of health are presented. This includes SEAs for five spatial plans, as well as one SEA for each, a transport, a waste management and an economic development plan. It is found that while all SEAs cover important physical and natural aspects that are related to health, social and behavioural aspects are considered to a much smaller extent. Based on the results, facilitating factors and barriers for health inclusive SEA are identified. Overall, good baseline data can be seen as an important starting point for effective health inclusive SEA, while an effective monitoring system is crucial for effective implementation of the measures and recommendations brought forward in health inclusive SEA. Crucially, health authorities/health experts need to engage more with SEA, as this provides a key platform for cross sectoral dialogue on a range of issues.

636,Evaluating the effectiveness of integrating the environmental impact assessment and mine closure planning processes,"Integration of environmental assessment tools has long been promoted as best practice with the potential to bring environmental benefits. In this research, we set out to evaluate the effectiveness of integration of environmental impact assessment (EIA) and mine closure planning using a simple effectiveness criteria framework, applied to current regulatory provisions and practices in Western Australia. The effectiveness criteria for the integration of EIA and mine closure planning, compiled from existing reviews of integration and effectiveness concepts in the impact assessment literature, considers procedural, transactive, substantive effectiveness and overall process legitimacy. Data analysis consisted of a literature review, examination of regulatory and guidance material and interviews with 12 experienced EIA and/or mine closure practitioners with an industry or regulatory focus. The results provide strong, positive examples of procedural, transactive and substantive effectiveness due to the integrated framework. These include behavioural changes, improved knowledge and learning and better provision for closure at an early stage of mine planning. A trajectory of improvement was noted by everybody interviewed. However, a key driver for effectiveness is the enthusiasm of key facilitations, and tension exists due to the different motivations of the two lead regulatory agencies which poses a challenge for the integrated framework. While it can reasonably be argued that the effectiveness of early mine closure planning cannot yet be realised, due to a paucity of completely closed mines in Australia this study nevertheless demonstrates clear benefits and opportunities result from early stage integration of EIA with mine closure planning. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.", Effectiveness; Environmental impact assessment; Integration; Mine closure planning,1.0
637,Rwandan environmental impact assessment: practices and constraints,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to review the Rwandan Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) practice and identify the possible constraints faced by EIA practitioners in Rwanda. The results presented here will help to highlight strengths and weakness of the Rwandan EIA practice. Design/methodology/approach: The EIA practice was evaluated by a self-administered questionnaire survey for respondents including approved EIA experts in Rwanda, government agencies involved in EIA process and corporate which have received environmental clearance. The aspects of practices and challenges were evaluated and include the suitability of institutional arrangements, the scientific methodological bases of EIA, the conduct of EIA, the effectiveness of EIA with respect to influence decision making, overall results and EIA as a learning process. These aspects were rated on different scales by the respondents to identify where the Rwandan EIA practice stands now in terms of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and constraints. Findings: The institutional arrangements of EIA were judged to be good overall by the respondents with main strengths being seen in the policy and legal base, and the scope of application. Only the marginal weaknesses are seen in the monitoring. The scientific and empirical basis for assessment was judged to stand moderately strengthened during the last five years. The performance of key activities is more than satisfactory. A majority of Rwandan EIA stages are good and excellent to some extent. Originality/value: This paper identifies some of the constraints and challenges faced by the Rwandan EIA practitioners.

638,Evaluating EIA systems' effectiveness: A state of the art,"Analyzing the effectiveness of environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an important theme in EIA literature. Over the course of its development, the manifold term “effectiveness” has been delineated into four dimensions: Procedural, substantive, transactive, and normative. The present state of the art review covers not only studies about these concepts, but also the methods used to test them. It analyzes trends in 64 studies over a 20-year period. It is observed that results oriented research is more common than process oriented, but given the links between results and processes, procedural effectiveness remains the lens through which policy solutions are analyzed. Future research is recommended comparing developing and developed countries as well as studies focusing on subnational EIA systems. Serious gaps in the literature remain, such as developing methods to evaluate the direct impact of EIA on decision-making and how to integrate the pluralism found in the EIA process for sustainable ends. Reliance on perceptual survey and interview methods is common for substantive and normative effectiveness studies. The least studied dimension, transactive dimension, requires more study, specifically the cost efficiency of EIA. Promisingly, multidimensional studies are becoming more common that highlight linkages among these dimensions, although the nature of these linkages must be tested with more case studies © 2017 Elsevier Inc.", Environmental impact assessment tools; Normative effectiveness; Procedural effectiveness; Substantive effectiveness; Transactive effectiveness,1.0
639,Improving the procedure of environmental audit of oil and gas facilities and industrial enterprises,"As a result of a systems analysis of economic activity of enterprises, the procedure for environmental impact reduction or prevention is proposed, which, at the stages of making and implementing decisions allows not to interfere with performing production functions of industrial facility, provide analysis of the results achieved and adjust its activity according to the results achieved. By carrying out the analysis and comparison of each stage of the conventional procedure for the environmental impact assessment (EIA) with the proposed stages of impact reduction or prevention, it was found that they coincide. The specificity of the EIA procedure lies in selecting methods in conditions of implementing individual stages of the procedure. In terms of the systems analysis, the environmental audit procedure corresponds to the EIA procedure and, in turn, to the proposed procedure for environmental impact reduction or prevention. The analogy between the objectives and procedures of the EIA and environmental audit (EA) has allowed to use expert decision support methods and EIA experience with specific modification during the EA. As a result, the improved EA procedure in terms of the environmental impact minimization, which during the EA provides higher probability and effectiveness of analysis, increases the efficiency of the auditors is developed.", Environment; Environmental audit; Environmental management; Expert system; Oil and gas complex,1.0
640,An ecological approach to environmental impact assessment,"Carbon cycling analysis is presented as a means for assessing anthropogenic perturbations in an ecosystem. Data from oligotrophic, eutrophic, and dystrophic (bog) lakes are used to show general trends in the lacustrine carbon cycle. The oligotrophic lake is an unstressed system and the eutrophic lake is under nutrient enrichment with high algal standing crops and productivity. The bog lake is a pH-stressed environment that is primarily a grazing ecosystem. It is hoped that a more effective environmental impact assessment will result from the use of carbon cycling as a unifying concept in ecosystem analysis. © 1978 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.", Carbon cycle; Environmental impact assessment; Lacustrine ecosystems,0.0
641,Climate impacts of bioenergy: Inclusion of carbon cycle and albedo dynamics in life cycle impact assessment,"Life cycle assessment (LCA) can be an invaluable tool for the structured environmental impact assessment of bioenergy product systems. However, the methodology's static temporal and spatial scope combined with its restriction to emission-based metrics in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) inhibits its effectiveness at assessing climate change impacts that stem from dynamic land surface-atmosphere interactions inherent to all biomass-based product systems. In this paper, we focus on two dynamic issues related to anthropogenic land use that can significantly influence the climate impacts of bioenergy systems: i) temporary changes to the terrestrial carbon cycle; and ii) temporary changes in land surface albedo-and illustrate how they can be integrated within the LCA framework. In the context of active land use management for bioenergy, we discuss these dynamics and their relevancy and outline the methodological steps that would be required to derive case-specific biogenic CO 2 and albedo change characterization factors for inclusion in LCIA. We demonstrate our concepts and metrics with application to a case study of transportation biofuel sourced from managed boreal forest biomass in northern Europe. We derive GWP indices for three land management cases of varying site productivities to illustrate the importance and need to consider case- or region-specific characterization factors for bioenergy product systems. Uncertainties and limitations of the proposed metrics are discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.", Biomass; Climate change; Forest management; GWP; Land use; LCA,0.0
642,EIA-driven biodiversity mainstreaming in development cooperation: Confronting expectations and practice in the DR Congo,"Mainstreaming biodiversity in development cooperation activities is called for by scientists and policy-makers alike, as the current biodiversity crisis can only be mitigated if the linkages between biodiversity and human wellbeing are acknowledged. Reconciling biodiversity conservation and human development is a particularly topical challenge in highly biodiverse developing countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where the population is highly dependent on natural resources for their livelihood. This study combines expert interviews with an evaluation of environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports, in order to determine the current motivations, obstacles and effectiveness of biodiversity mainstreaming in the DRC and to assess the framing, the representation and use of biodiversity in recently conducted EIAs in the DRC. Our findings indicate that biodiversity mainstreaming in the DRC is considered challenging due to enduring contextual (e.g. governance) factors; and that there is a strong support base for EIA among the interviewed experts. Turning to actual EIAs that were recently performed in the DRC, the diversity of framings motivating the uptake of biodiversity is remarkable. Instrumental reasons do not thwart intrinsic motivations –which is indicative of a support base for the non-instrumental value of biodiversity. The use of biodiversity baseline data in mitigation measures is low, and the taxonomic resolution of the biodiversity data in EIAs is uneven. Despite these challenges, the potential of EIA in the DRC is considered high, and linkages between project-driven EIA practice and biodiversity data collection and dissemination should be strengthened. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd", Biodiversity; Congo; Development; EIA; Environmental impact assessment; Mainstreaming,1.0
643,Environmental impact assessment of offshore wind farms: A simulation-based approach,"1. Assessing and monitoring the impact of offshore wind farms on marine fauna is vital if we want to achieve ecologically sustainable development of this renewable energy resource. Given the complexity of the marine environment, a method capable of accommodating spatio-temporal behaviour of specific species and their interrelation with other marine phenomena is an essential prerequisite for investigating whether or not there has been any measurable impact to date.2. This paper presents a method based on geostatistical simulation to assess whether pre- and post-construction collected bird count data suggest displacement of birds due to the wind farm. The method takes into account spatial autocorrelation in species abundance at various scales, pre- and post-construction differences in environmental conditions and in survey effort and design.3. We demonstrate that taking these factors into account influences the conclusions about a wind farm's impact on bird life. In particular, incorporating spatial autocorrelation in seabird numbers is an important factor in reducing the risk of wrongly identifying an effect of a wind farm on bird abundance.4. Synthesis and applications. The development of offshore wind farms is often in conflict with nature conservation interests. Environmental impact assessment and monitoring is essential to protect and manage the marine environment. The method described here will allow scarce data to be utilized effectively as a basis for well-informed environmental decisions. In addition, the method will assist in the design of optimal monitoring procedures at a given site, balancing costs and effectiveness in detecting potentially harmful impacts. © 2010 The Authors.

644,The legal regime governing sea transport of ultrahazardous radioactive materials,"Although the international community has taken some steps to address the risks created by the movements of ultrahazardous radioactive cargoes, important gaps still exist in the legal regime governing these activities. An apparent consensus has been reached at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to make the Code for the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium, and High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks Aboard Ships (the INF Code) mandatory and to seek some clarification of the standards governing shipboard safety. But still lacking are agreements regarding salvage responsibilities, liability of shippers for damages, revision of transport cask safety standards to meet maritime accident conditions, obligations to consult regarding the best routes and to provide advance notification to concerned coastal states, the preparation of environmental assessments, and contingency planning to handle shore emergencies and salvage responsibilities. Until agreements are reached on these important matters, the shipment of these extremely dangerous or ""ultrahazardous"" materials will continue to violate fundamental norms of international law and comity because they place coastal nations that receive no benefit from the shipments at grave risk of environmental disaster without any legal protections. Because the shipments of ultrahazardous radioactive cargoes are increasing, it is highly advisable for concerned nations to negotiate regional protocols delineating the legal regime that applies to these maritime transports. A draft model protocol is attached at the end of this article which may provide guidance on this effort. It is also appropriate for concerned nations to consider bringing a claim against the shipping nations under the dispute resolution mechanisms established by the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention. Such a claim would be based on the failure of the shipping nations to comply with their obligations under the convention to prepare and distribute environmental impact assessments, consult with affected nations, prepare emergency contingency plans, and agree to an effective liability regime in the event of an accident. Because of the grave potential risks created by these shipments and because of the failure of the shippers to meet their obligations to protect coastal nations from these risks, coastal nations may be justified under international law to take unilateral or regional action to block future shipments.", Duty to consult; Environmental protection; Liability; Navigational freedoms; Plutonium; Radioactive material,1.0

Improvement in coverage is noted and real commitment to good environmental impact assessment (EIA) practice is found in those responsible for the EIS system. Project proponents show a modest acceptance of the system. Major problems remaining are: (1) the EIS system is seen as a bureaucratic requirement needed to obtain project approvals; (2) political interference determines the outcome of some environmental reviews; (3) questionable practices by public servants serve to discredit the system; and (4) the treatment of projects in environmentally critical areas is less than satisfactory. Based on the principle that it is essential to establish a credible process seen to work effectively by the public, politicians, the government bureaucracy, and proponents, suggestions for improvement are made.

646,Protecting the Habitats of Endangered Species Through Environmental Public Interest Litigation in China: Lessons Learned from Peafowl Versus the Dam,"Green Peafowl stands as a landmark lawsuit in China where environmental NGOs successfully halted a project threatening habitat of endangered species. By examining this case, this analysis evaluates the promise and limitations of China's civil environmental public interest litigation (EPIL) in protecting habitat. Under civil EPIL's broad and flexible framework, environmental NGOs can convince the courts that a government-approved project would destroy the 'biological habitat' for endangered species and hold project developers accountable. By arguing that the environmental impact assessment (EIA) institution is jointly liable by preparing a flawed report, environmental NGOs can also use civil EPIL as an alternative avenue to challenge the quality of an approved EIA report. However, the timing of judicial intervention, uncertainties of litigation outcomes, the scope of protection, and the court's attitude towards EIA claims limit the effectiveness of civil EPIL. This analysis highlights the need to address regulatory failures revealed by Green Peafowl.  © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

647,Developing a coupled environmental impact assessment (C-EIA) method with sustainable development approach for environmental analysis in coal industries,"Abstract: Mining and the mineral industry have always been one of the main environmental challenges of human societies. In the current research, a coupled method for environmental assessment of coal industries was presented. At first, an inventory of the plant activities and the environmental impacts were prepared. Then, four EIA methods, including Leopold matrix, modified Folchi, AHP method, and RIAM matrix, were used to assess the environmental impacts of the plant. After that, the coupled environmental impact assessment (C-EIA) method was used to integrate the outcomes of different EIA techniques. The result of different methods compared with each other, and then, they are combined using both the Borda and Copland methods and a novel method called direct ranking strategy. Finally, the obtained results from these three methods are integrated as well, to provide a unique address for the environmental impact assessment of the plant. Developed C-EIA method was used for assessing the Alborz Sharghi coal washing plant of northeastern Iran and its impacts on the surrounding environment. The most effective impacting factor of the plant on the critical components was evaluated as the “material existed in the tailings” that should be considered in any factory development plans. By using the Phillips method and the sustainable development index (SDI), the quantitative dependence value of the plant to the sustainable development components was estimated, and the plant sustainability number (S) was obtained (− 0.0395). This SD number means that some modifications should be taken on the project. C-EIA method and SDI are the powerful methods for quantitative environmental analysis of the industrial factories especially in coal mining sector with high-risk potential. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.", Alborz Sharghi coal washing plant; Coupled EIA; Direct Ranking Strategy (SDR); Philips method; Sustainable development index (SDI),1.0
648,Cumulative effects assessment: A review of UK environmental impact statements,"The consideration of cumulative effects in environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been required in the UK, though somewhat ambiguously, since the EC Directive (85/337/EEC) was implemented in 1988. This paper describes the results of a review of cumulative effects considerations in 50 UK environmental impact statements (EISs) prepared for a variety of project types produced between 1989 and 2000. The results of the review suggest that cumulative effects are far from thoroughly addressed. Only 24 EISs (48%) mentioned the term 'cumulative effects/impacts' and only 9 EISs (18%) provided a discussion, which were mostly qualitative. The problems in addressing these issues are explored, and the main findings include the various interpretations of the concept of cumulative effects and the varied treatment of cumulative effects issues. Where cumulative effects are considered in the scoping stage, this led to a further discussion or analysis of these effects. The research concludes that for a better consideration of cumulative effects, an effective driving force would be the local planning authority (and other competent authorities) requiring developers during the scoping process to address cumulative effects and so help meet the most recent strengthened legal requirements of the EC EIA Amendment Directive 97/11/EC and UK Regulations. More tailored guidance for developers and authorities alike is needed for this to happen. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

There have been very few attempts to look back after tourism development to judge the effectiveness of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) and the steps taken to reduce adverse impacts. The planning of the 1992 Winter Olympics took account of potential direct adverse impacts on the environment, but was not without its critics. Secondary and longer-term impacts include some effects which were not foreseen, whereas others were already occurring. The benefits and costs to the environment result from trade-offs between interest groups at a variety of levels within the local economy and its administration.

650,Toward an analytical framework for understanding complex socialecological systems when conducting environmental impact assessments in South Africa,"Consideration of biophysical impacts has historically dominated environmental impact assessment (EIA) practice. Despite the emergence of social impact assessment, the consideration of socioeconomic impacts in EIA is variable, as is the extent of their integration in EIA findings. There is growing recognition for the need to move EIA practice toward sustainability assessment, characterized by comprehensiveness, i.e., scope of impacts, integration, i.e., of biophysical and socioeconomic impacts, and a greater strategic focus. This is particularly the case in developing regions and in countries like South Africa, which have statutory requirements for the full consideration of socioeconomic impacts in EIA. We suggest that EIA practice could benefit from incorporating evolving theory around social-ecological systems (SES) as an effective way of moving toward sustainability assessment. As far as we are aware, our study constitutes the first attempt to apply and formalize SES constructs to EIA practice within a regulated procedure. Our framework goes beyond conventional scoping approaches reliant on checklists and matrices by requiring the EIA practitioner to cocreate a conceptual model of the current and future social-ecological system with the implicated communities. This means social and biophysical impacts are assessed integratively, and that communities participate meaningfully in the EIA process, thereby helping address two of the most common shortfalls of EIA practice. The framework was applied in two case studies, establishment of communitybased accommodation linked to existing tourism infrastructure (Eastern Cape, South Africa), and a proposed wine estate (KwaZulu- Natal, South Africa). The framework revealed impacts, which would not be considered in a biophysically-oriented EIA, and helped identify development synergies and institutional and governance needs that are equally likely to have been overlooked. We suggest the framework has value as a counterpoint to established approaches and could contribute to improving the quality of EIAs with respect to the complex SESs that characterize the developing world. © 2015 by the author(s).", Ecosystem services; Environmental impact assessment (EIA); Framework; Participation; Social-ecological system (SES); Sustainability assessment,1.0
651,NEPA effectiveness - A survey of academics,"The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) went into effect in the United States on January 1, 1970, just over 25 years ago. In light of this milestone, a survey of academics on the effectiveness of NEPA has been conducted regarding the preparation of environmental assessments (EAs) or environmental impact statements (EISs). This paper summarizes the results of a survey of 31 academics in 12 disciplines from 21 states; the majority of which have over 20 years of experience in teaching, research and/or practice of the NEPA process. Several strengths of NEPA were identified, most importantly that NEPA encourages agencies and decision makers: (1) to acknowledge potential environmental consequences to the public, thus opening up the decision process; and (2) to think about environmental consequences before resources are committed. Surveyed participants also prioritized needs for improvement; the five most important were: (1) post-EIS follow-up in monitoring, implementation of mitigation measures, ecosystem management, and environmental auditing; (2) methodological approaches for addressing cumulative impacts and reductions in institutional barriers to analysis of cumulative impacts; (3) training of federal personnel implementing NEPA; (4) earlier considerations of NEPA in project planning and decision making; and (5) the integrated consideration of biophysical and social/economic sciences, along with risk assessment, in NEPA. While this survey was focused on the NEPA process in the United States, the identified issues have implications for the worldwide practice of environmental impact assessment.

652,Road effects on wildlife in brazilian environmental licensing,"Environmental licensing is a political tool to protect the environment and encourage sustainable development. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are the important document for impact assessment of activities during environmental licensing, and all decision-making process and effectiveness depend on its quality. Road construction, paving and widening require the approval of an EIA, since these activities are responsible for a large number of environmental impacts. Here we present an analysis of 16 EIAs of Brazilian roads, considering the impacts on terrestrial and aquatic fauna. We discuss if the impacts recognized in road ecology literature are identified and assessed in these studies, if mitigation actions are based on information presented on the EIA, and the quality of road mortality assessment. We based the analysis on a checklist of road impacts and on scores calculated based on a set of criteria. We calculated relative scores for each EIA and for each type of impact across all studies. EIA quality was low (more than half EIAs had relative equal score or less than 50%); the studies analyzed poorly addressed the impacts recognized in the academic literature. The presence of impacts was not coherent along different sections of the EIA (baseline studies, impact matrix and proposition of mitigation measures). In 27.63% of cases the impacts were not present in any section of the EIA. In some situations, the impact was present in the baseline studies, but not in impact matrix or mitigation propositions, and in half of the situations analyzed the relative score of EIAs was lower than 30% for the quality of road mortality impact assessment. We recommend the improvement of the terms of reference should be a priority to enforce the elaboration of enhanced quality studies.

653,"The effectiveness of the Finnish EIA system - What works, what doesn't, and what could be improved?","The article summarises the results of a multidisciplinary research project on the effectiveness of the Finnish EIA system. It examines the main strengths and weaknesses of EIA as a preventive and participatory environmental management tool. The study concludes that EIA has achieved a meaningful role in the environmental policy toolbox in Finland and has clearly enhanced the possibilities for high-quality environmental decision making. The research cites the liaison authority system as a clear strength of the Finnish EIA system in its enabling a single regional authority to specialise in and gain wide experience on EIA issues. In examining potential weaknesses of the regime, the article concludes that the key constraint on EIA effectiveness is inadequacy of the action-forcing mechanisms at the decision-making phase. The primary means to improve the effectiveness of EIA would be to strengthen the legal provisions on development consents. On the whole, the research indicates that the EU and Finnish legislation and guidance on environmental impact assessment provide a good framework for effective utilisation of the instrument. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.", Effectiveness; EIA legislation; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental policy instruments; Public participation,1.0
654,Environmental critique on water resources environmental impact assessment of bangladesh,"The water resources sector of Bangladesh relies on the Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) to assess the possible positive and negative impacts on the environmental and social components of the project affected area. The motivation of this research was to identify the key environmental components, gaps and lapses of current EIA practices in water resources sector of Bangladesh. Under the motivation, this study has determined the effectiveness of a water resources EIA (Gorai River Restoration Project) for sustainable implication of water resources development and management projects in Bangladesh. Component-based checklist method and effectiveness review framework were used in this study to draw conclusions and to make environmental judgment on the important sections of the studied EIA. Review of the key aspects and the analysis of the effectiveness framework disclosed that the studied EIA is well performed and provides sufficient information for decision making, but residual and unavoidable impacts were not identified for all the important environment components in the construction and operation phase. Inclusion of important environmental and social components under different intervention scenarios, consideration of alternative flow regimes, alternative options with ensuring public participation were the key strengths of the studies EIA. The considered environmental issues and aspects under the critique can be used as guidelines for future EIAs under the similar geo-environmental contexts. The review framework developed in this study can be implemented in water resources EIA review process to ensure long-term sustainability of water resources projects. © 2014 Science Publication.", Effectiveness review framework; EIA; EMP; Water resources,1.0
655,Thermal and environmental impact analysis of rice husk ash-based mortar as insulating wall plaster,"The energy used to maintain the thermal comfort of buildings significantly contributes to the GHG emissions and global warming. In this study, a sustainable and cost-effective rice husk ash (RHA)-based mortar for wall plastering has been developed to provide better thermal insulation, reduce the operational energy and enhance the thermal comfort. Consequently, RHA was partially replaced with the sand in the conventional mortar to produce the RHA-based plaster. Initially, compressive strengths and thermal conductivities of the selected mortar mixes were assessed. The results highlight that the RHA can be replaced up to 30% instead of sand in mortar to produce the thermally enhanced wall plaster. Further, two identical prototype model houses were constructed with RHA-based (i.e. 30% of RHA) and conventional plasters to evaluate their heat transfer, heat flux, and the characteristics of internal and external wall surface temperatures in open weather conditions. It was noted that the average peak heat flux reduction formed by the RHA-based plaster was 10%. The average daily heat transfer reduction across the wall with RHA-based plaster was about 26%. Results also show that RHA-based plaster can reduce the energy that required to maintain thermal comfort by about 9% than the conventional plaster. Moreover, the environmental impact analysis was also conducted to assess the sustainability performance of RHA-based mortars. The environmental impact assessment revealed that the RHA-based plaster has less environmental impact than the conventional mortar. Furthermore, the CO2 emission generated by the production of RHA-based mortar is about 14% less than the conventional plaster. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd", Compressive strength; Heat flux; Heat transfer analysis; Life cycle assessment; Plaster; Rice husk ash; Thermal properties,1.0
656,Conflict dynamics in a dam construction project: A case study,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present a model for a comprehensive and integrated approach to managing interface conflict from the early stages of a dam construction project. Design/methodology/approach: A case study methodology is adopted. Following comprehensive literature review, qualitative data were gathered from case studies through interviews conducted on the Middle Marsyangdi Hydroelectric Project (MMHEP) dam project in Nepal. Causal loop diagrams on the typical evolution of key indicators of interface conflict were then developed and a simulate-able model of interface conflict was derived using system dynamic modeling technique. The model was then simulated to derive viable policies for future management of dam construction projects in developing countries. Findings: The study reveals that interface conflicts at the construction stage of projects are caused mainly by lack of effective Environmental Impact Assessment, public participation and mutual consultation, on timely basis and accurate information from the early stages of projects. The system dynamic model is able to replicate general behavior of evolution of interface conflict in a dam construction project. Furthermore, the study explored three viable policies to avoid and minimize interface conflict in the construction stage of a dam project. The policies were tested and demonstrated to be useful in improving the value of projects to stakeholders. It is demonstrated that a combination of policies is better than adopting a single policy to stakeholder management. Originality/value: The paper demonstrates the utility of system dynamics as a modeling tool for understanding the dynamics of conflicts on dam construction projects. The model should be helpful to policy makers on large projects, especially those likely to be subject to social and environmental conflict. Policies derived from the model have the potential of being used to assess and take proactive measures to manage conflicts effectively and efficiently from early in a project's life. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.", Dam construction; Dams; Developing countries; Interface conflict; Nepal; Project management; Sustainable construction; System dynamics,1.0
657,Linking Environmental Assessment and Management of Highway Construction in Southeastern Brazil,"Effective delivery of mitigation remains a challenge in environmental impact assessment (EIA) practice. Actual environmental protection outcomes depend as much on an appropriate ex-Ante assessment as on the capacity of project proponents of implementing preventative, corrective and compensatory programs, using environmental management tools to ensure demonstrable performance. The context question explored here is: How can the EIA follow-up phase take advantage of the features and resources of environmental management systems (EMS)? Evidence was obtained by studying two cases of highway construction affecting valued environments. The projects, intentionally selected, were built in the same area with an eight-year interval between them. Follow-up resulted in the identification of significant unforeseen geo-environmental impacts leading to the adoption of corrective action not required in the terms and conditions of approval. It was found that lessons learned by different actors involved in the first project led to stronger environmental management procedures incorporated in the latter. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.", Effectiveness; EIA follow-up; environmental management systems; environmental supervision; geo-environmental impacts; knowledge transfer,1.0
658,Social impact assessment: Practitioner perspectives of the neglected status in south african sia,"Social Impact Assessment (SIA) in South Africa is still considered to be a neglected component of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), but the perspectives of the practitioners on the status and practice of SIA have never been probed, despite their key role in SIA. This paper explores those perspectives by means of a two-part survey conducted with an availability sample of 11 SIA practitioners in 2012 and 13 practitioners in 2016 following a qualitative Action Research Approach. Four themes emerged (i.e. SIA in practice, Problems in SIA, Effectiveness of SIA and the Future of SIA). It is evident that the practitioners generally agree about the nature and purpose of SIA, that SIA has problems but is healthy and will benefit from some regulation, that SIA is an important and valuable tool, although with limited effectiveness, and the practitioners are optimistic about the future of SIA. The perspectives of the practitioners are aligned with international trends towards enhancement and sustainability assessment, but they must remain committed to best practice in SIA. © 2018 Society of South African Geographers.", Perspectives; SIA practitioners; Social impact assessment (SIA); South Africa,1.0
659,A web application to support the quantification and valuation of ecosystem services,"Assessing the impacts of policies on a wide range of ecosystem services can support the development of cost-effective policies that establish win-win situations across different environmental domains. To explore the quantity and value of ecosystem services, the web-based application ""nature value explorer""was developed. The application allows to estimate the impact of land use and land cover change on regulating and cultural ecosystemservices in Flanders, Belgium. To ensure the applicability in day-to-day decision making as part of environmental impact assessments, user requirements were investigated prior to tool development. Finding the optimal balance between accuracy and complexity on the one hand and flexibility and user-friendliness on the other hand was an important challenge. To date, the nature value explorer has been successful in drawing the interest of policy makers and has been used several times to support decisions in infrastructure projects as well as in nature restoration projects in Flanders. This paper discusses the user requirements, the main tool characteristics, potential policy applications and future improvements.

Additionally, this paper presents a comparative detoxification investigation and subsequent fermentation of the resulting FS using Pichia stipitis. The optimum Ga4Mo-GF (with a gallium precursor loading of 4 wt%) photocatalyst exhibited impressive characteristics, including a high specific surface area (28.01 m2 g−1), high pore volume (0.04198 cc g−1) and lower band gap energy (2.3 eV), providing a maximum 78.35 mol% FS yield under mild reaction conditions (100 °C and 20 min) with mild energy consumption (12 kJ mL−1). The comparative hydrolysate detoxification study highlighted the superior efficacy of the Amberlite IRP69 cation resin, achieving maximum removal rates of 86% for furfural, 92% for formic acid, and 95% for levulinic acid compared to other methods. Furthermore, the hydrolysate detoxified using Amberlite IRP69 resulted in a higher bioethanol concentration (4.32 mmol mL−1) compared to NaOH neutralization (3.06 mmol mL−1), Ca(OH)2 over-liming (2.88 mmol mL−1), and ethyl acetate solvent extraction (3.73 mmol mL−1) when fermented with Pichia stipitis. Additionally, the overall environmental impact assessment indicated that utilizing the Amberlite IRP69 cation resin not only enhanced bioethanol yield but also reduced environmental impacts. Remarkably, the optimized Ga4Mo-GF catalyst demonstrated reusability for up to 7 cycles in the DCC hydrolysis process, showcasing its stability and the consequential reduction in environmental impacts throughout the corncob to bioethanol conversion process. © 2024 RSC.", ,0.0
661,Landscape Planning on the Way to Integration in Regional Policy,"Abstract: One of the modern areas of landscape science is socially oriented (landscape planning, environmental impact assessment, and landscape aesthetics and design). In Russia, however, it has found itself outside of regional policy, the concept, theory, and practice of which do not include landscape planning. Indicatively, the European Landscape Convention, adopted in 2000, has not yet been ratified by the legislative bodies of the Russian Federation. Meanwhile, the landscape ecological ideology of territorial planning makes it possible to develop planning solutions with equal consideration not only of the territory’s own properties but also of its functions in a system of a higher rank. The basic units of such planning are natural landscape units. A spatial decision is made after a thorough analysis of the functional significance of the natural territorial complex in terms of preserving the landscape diversity of the region or the country as a whole. A forecast of possible chain reactions between landscape components is carried out. When placing sites and determining their optimal proportions, sizes, configuration, and orientation, lateral connections between geosystems are considered. The regulation of land use in time is based on the forecast of dynamic and evolutionary changes. The diversity of landscape processes and values is taken into account to identify the possibilities for the multifunctional use of landscape elements. Landscape planning can become an effective tool of regional policy, which will smooth out the contradictions among natural restrictions and threats, the need to preserve environmental values, and economic and social interests. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.", ecological framework; flow; landscape; placement; planning; regional policy; site; suitability; value,0.0
662,Regionalized environmental impacts of construction machinery,"Purpose: This study aims to establish a regionalized environmental impact assessment of construction machinery equipped with diesel engines certified by the European emission standard Stage V, and operated in cold climatic zones in Europe. Method: The study quantifies potential environmental impacts associated with construction machinery over the entire lifecycle, from extraction of materials to the end-of-life. For the operation phase, a meso-level emission accounting method is applied to quantify tailpipe emissions for certain subcategories of construction machinery. This is achieved by determining the operational efficiency of each machine in terms of effective hours. The quantified emission data are then adjusted based on engine deterioration models to estimate the rate of increase in emissions throughout the lifetime of each machine. Finally, the CML impact assessment method is applied to inventory data to quantify potential environmental impacts. Results: The study shows that tailpipe emissions, which largely depend on an engine’s fuel consumption, had the largest contribution to environmental impacts in most impact categories. At the same time, there was a positive correlation between the operation weight and the impacts of the machinery. Also, machinery with similar operation weight had relatively similar impact patterns due to similar driving factors and dependencies. In addition, network, sensitivity, and uncertainty analyses were performed to quantify the source of impacts and validate the robustness of the study. Results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the responsiveness of the studied systems is very sensitive to changes in the amount of fuel consumption. In addition, the uncertainty results showed that the domain of uncertainty increased as the operation weight subcategory of machinery increased. Conclusion: This study extends previous work on the life cycle assessment (LCA) of construction machinery, and the methodology developed provides a basis for future extension and improvement in this field. The use of effective hours as the unit of operational efficiency helps to resolve uncertainties linked to lifetime and annual operation hours. Also, the obtained results can be of use for decision support and for assessing the impacts of transition from fossil fuels to alternative fuel types. © 2020, The Author(s).", Attributional LCA; Construction machinery; Life cycle assessment; Non-road mobile machinery,0.0
663,Multi-jurisdictional environmental impact assessment: Canadian experiences,"This research examines complexities surrounding environmental impact assessment (EIA) in a multi-jurisdictional environment, with a specific focus on opportunities for public participation. With almost universal adoption of EIA, projects are increasingly subject to more than one assessment process. Thus there is demand to facilitate inter-jurisdictional coordination of EIAs. Canada has growing expertise with multijuristictional EIA that serves to illustrate the costs and opportunities associated with three different approaches to coordination: standardization, harmonization and substitution. Findings suggest that, although fraught with issues, harmonization is the most realistic approach for coordinating efforts. Harmonization has the potential to minimize duplication, avoid process uncertainty and increase efficiency and effectiveness in EIA. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that a bilateral agreement between jurisdictions is the best approach to harmonization, so long as negotiation of the agreement includes opportunities for meaningful participation, and implementation includes activities designed to communicate the assessment responsibilities of each jurisdiction, activities and schedules to the public. The experience of participants of different coordinated EIAs in Canada serves as counsel for on-going and future efforts to facilitate inter-jurisdictional coordination. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

665,Co-production of public policy to mitigate animal-vehicle collisions on roads in Brazil,"Roads worldwide contribute to biodiversity loss through animal-vehicle collisions, impacting ecological connectivity and ecosystem functioning. Despite existing environmental impact assessment procedures for road operations, the absence of specific rules for planning mitigation measures raises major concerns about the effectiveness of current practices. To address these challenges, a two-year co-production process was initiated to develop a novel regulation for mitigating animal-vehicle collisions in Brazil. This collaborative effort involved over 90 stakeholders, including the state environmental agency, road administrators, researchers, and legal representatives. The process, characterized by its context-based, pluralistic, goal-oriented, and interactive nature, resulted in a framework for developing and implementing mitigation plans. The process included detailing context definition, reviewing existing public policies, identifying participants, creating an official working group, conducting monthly virtual meetings, and a public consultation. Despite challenges in participant engagement and decision-making in the absence of evidence, the co-production process demonstrated the importance of inclusivity, a formalized working group, and a core team in structuring discussions. Recommendations for future practice include participative processes, transparent public consultation, and a realistic schedule for implementing mitigation measures.

The investigation is focused on the situation in Germany as a frontrunner in ecological research on offshore wind energy. After 10 years of research in Germany, it is timely to offer a synopsis of the results especially regarding the successful investigations of mitigation measures. The results are based on published data collected in Germany over the last 10 years, as well as international research. The outcomes of the research were validated by interviewing experts using the Delphi method. Key findings for good practice in impact assessment, mitigation and compensation: 1. EIAs should focus on decision-relevant subjects of protection (i.e. specific bird species and harbour porpoises). 2. There is a strong necessity for thresholds for the approval process. 3. Exclusion of OWFs in hotspots of sensitive species. 4. Application of state-of-the-art mitigation measures particularly against underwater noise to avoid damages of the hearing of porpoises. 5.

667,Screening for EIA in India: Enhancing effectiveness through ecological carrying capacity approach,"Developing countries across the world have embraced the policy of high economic growth as a means to reduce poverty. This economic growth largely based on industrial output is fast degrading the ecosystems, jeopardizing their long term sustainability. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has long been recognized as a tool which can help in protecting the ecosystems and aid sustainable development. The Screening guidelines for EIA reflect the level of commitment the nation displays towards tightening its environmental protection system. The paper analyses the screening process for EIA in India and dissects the rationale behind the exclusions and thresholds set in the screening process. The screening process in India is compared with that of the European Union with the aim of understanding the extent of deviations from a screening approach in the context of better economic development. It is found that the Indian system excludes many activities from the purview of screening itself when compared to the EU. The constraints responsible for these exclusions are discussed and the shortcomings of the current command and control system of environmental management in India are also explained. It is suggested that an ecosystem carrying capacity based management system can provide significant inputs to enhance the effectiveness of EIA process from screening to monitoring. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.", Ecological carrying capacity; Environmental impact assessment; India; Participatory ecosystem management; Screening,1.0
668,Raising the game in environmental assessment: Insights from tiering practice,"The organised transfer of information between Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) processes – also known as tiering – has the potential to enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of environmental assessments and improve the coherence of information to support decisions. Nevertheless, research on tiering practice is limited and the added value of tiering to SEA, EIA and planning processes remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by examining tiering practice across sectors and planning tiers in the Republic of Ireland. It reviews nine SEA environmental reports and associated EIA reports, supplementing the review findings with 14 national expert interviews. The research reveals that SEAs can streamline processes by shaping alternatives, anticipating project-level issues and mitigation, and thus setting the terms of reference for EIA for more focused assessments and actions. When SEA and EIA ‘talk’ to each other, there is greater coherence, purpose and clarity of information which can result, ultimately, in better integration of environmental considerations across tiers, helping ensure that impacts are not significant on the ground. Although more apparent and effective in certain procedural stages, overall, tiering streamlines and strengthens environmental assessment processes, ‘raising the game’ through improved practice. © 2021 The Authors", Alternatives; Environmental impact assessment; Information flow; Mitigation; Monitoring; Strategic environmental assessment,1.0

670,The significance of resource recycling for coking wastewater treatment: based on environmental and economic life cycle assessment,"The sustainability of the coking industry is supported by reasonable production profit and environmental quality requirements. The traditional measures substantially increased the related costs for enterprises to reach standards. This paper aims to develop a comprehensive cost combined environmental impact assessment method that is necessary for the analysis of wastewater treatment systems. Typical three coking wastewater treatment processes in China were evaluated. Results showed that eutrophication dominantly contributed to the overall environmental effect. Improving effluent quality could significantly reduce the total environmental impact. In terms of an economic perspective, the price of raw materials was the main factor that affected the operating cost of comprehensive treatment. Based on subsystem analysis, the pretreatment stage accounted for the majority of environmental and cost burdens, respectively reaching 64%–78% and 64%–86%. Optimizing the pretreatment process by enhancing the efficiency of high concentration raw material recovery and substituting toxic raw materials for extractant could reduce the environmental impact and economic cost by 43.8% and 57%, respectively, which was an effective way to improve the potential performance of coking wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). © 2022 Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.", Coking wastewater treatment; Comprehensive benefits; Economic evaluation; Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment; Resource recycling,0.0
671,Public participation in environmental impact assessments between Spain and Portugal,"Since 2000, the Transboundary Environmental Impact Assessment (TEIA) process in the Iberian context has undergone significant development due to new circumstances that came into play at the bilateral and European levels: (i) the adoption of a collaborative TEIA Protocol between Spain and Portugal in 2008; and (ii) the increasing number of cross-border projects supported by European Union funds. Despite these developments, the impact of this bilateral regulation on public participation, the cornerstone of any Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), has not yet been fully examined. Drawing from specific literature focusing on the involvement of the public as the basis of effective improvement of the TEIA, this paper critically analyses if the lates transboundary provision has encouraged public participation in this context. Although the analysis of the TEIA enforcement revealed a considerable increase in the number of consultations between the neighbouring states compared to the previous situation, public involvement has not increased. Based on these findings, this paper presents a set of recommendations to more effectively involve the public in transboundary consultations. © 2015 Imperial College Press.", EIA; implementation; Portugal; public participation; Spain; transboundary consultation,1.0
672,"Oxygen penetration and mineral stability within the San Manuel tailings, AZ","Environmental impact assessment of tailings storage facilities focuses on defining the reactivity and potential for acid rock drainage and metal leaching (ARDML) through geochemical testing of representative samples and numerical predictive calculations. The acid generation potential of tailings is dependent on the reactivity of their sulphide content which is directly proportional to the oxygen concentration within the material. As such, predicting the oxygen concentration as a function of time and depth is critical to understand the acid generation potential of tailings material. The aim of this study was to predict the oxygen flux and concentration as a function of time and depth within the San Manuel flotation copper tailings in Arizona, USA. This flow was combined with mineralogical data, including the presence of encapsulated sulphide, oxygen and moisture content to model oxidation and metal release in the tailings. Numerical simulations, using reactive transport code MIN3P, correctly reproduced the San Manuel field and analytical results when the sulphide reactivity was controlled by reducing the effective sulphide mass within the numerical models from total sulphide to available sulphide. These calculations effectively demonstrated that an effective control minimizing sulphide oxidation exists within a portion of the San Manuel tailings. © 2018 The Author(s).", ARDML; MIN3P; Numerical modelling; San Manuel tailings,1.0
673,A Parametric BIM Framework to Conceptual Structural Design for Assessing the Embodied Environmental Impact,"Decisions made in the early design stage have a significant effect on a building’s performance and environmental impact. In practice, a conceptual design is performed by an architect, while a structural engineer begins to work in later phases when the architectural concept has already evolved. However, the geometry and form of a building directly determine the type of structure and applicable materials; therefore, the conceptual design phase gives rise to examining alternative solutions. This paper presents a method for generating alternative structural solutions in the conceptual design phase and examining their embodied environmental impact by integrating parametric design and building information modeling (BIM). Rhinoceros and Grasshopper were used to develop the parametric script, which includes the generation of geometrical variations, the automatic definition of initial cross sections for the load-bearing elements based on in-built structural design approximations, the datasets for embodied environmental impact of the used building materials, the generation of life cycle inventory (LCI), the automatic calculation of life cycle assessment (LCA) results based on the geometry, and the conversion of the parametric model into building information model. The method was demonstrated using a case study of 48 different alternative solutions for an unheated warehouse made of steel frames. Based on the results, the areas with the greatest energy impact were identified.

674,Assessment of information availability for environmental impact assessment of engineered nanomaterials,"Environmental impact assessments of engineered nanomaterials can be hampered by the lack of data/information and thus delay the development of effective regulatory policies. To address this issue, a systematic approach (termed here “IANano”) was developed and demonstrated for assessing information availability for environmental impact assessment (EIA) of engineered nanomaterials. In IANano, following the typical EIA process, the required information elements for exposure and hazard potential assessments are classified based on major categories, sub-categories, and attributes. Scores for the different information attributes are then assigned, based on a selected scoring scale and weights, and aggregated up to the level of exposure and hazard potential information (EPI and hazard potential information [HPI], respectively), considering both available and unavailable information, via the Dempster-Shafer algorithm. The utility of IANano was demonstrated for several specific EIA scenarios for nano-TiO                             2                             , nano-Cu-CuO, and nano-ZnO. For the three nanomaterials, in each of the different EIA scenarios, the EPI scores were lower than the HPI scores, consistent with the more abundant information available for hazard attributes. For nano-TiO                             2                             , the exposure potential information (EPI) scores were in the range of 0.33–0.72 and higher by 60–50% and 42–46% relative to nano-Cu-CuO and nano-ZnO, respectively, for all EIA scenarios. For the scenario of direct release of engineered nanomaterials to the aquatic environment, the HPI scores for nano-Cu-CuO and nano-ZnO were greater by factors of 2.6 and 1.3, respectively, relative to the EPI scores. Results of the present study suggest that information screening, as illustrated via IANano, can be valuable for ranking the adequacy of the available information for conducting specific EIAs and for identifying information needs.                          © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.", Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs); Environmental impact assessment (EIA); Evidential reasoning; Exposure potential information; Hazard potential information,0.0
675,Adapting an environmental impact assessment method for open pit mines in Myanmar: A modified semi-mathematical Folchi approach,"Since 1970, the global adoption of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has fostered the development of multiple EIA methodologies, ranging from sample techniques to scientific approaches, for assessing environmental impacts. These methodologies encompass diverse models such as Ad hoc, matrices, checklist, network, overlay, mathematical, simulation, and dispersion models. Among these, the Folchi method is one of the quantitative matrix methods, assigning magnitudes to each impacting factor based on different possible scenarios. In this method, a matrix consisting of weighting factors is systematically utilized to quantify and standardize the effect of each impacting factor on various environmental components. Myanmar, as a developing nation that has recently implemented EIA practices, has encountered significant challenges in the realm of EIA, particularly concerning methodologies for impact evaluation, assessment, and the formulation of effective mitigation measures for various development projects. To address these challenges, this study introduces an adapted semi-mathematical Folchi EIA method, demonstrating its application in open-pit mines across Myanmar. Adjustments were made to integrate domestic environmental guidelines and EIA procedures, often overlooked in previous studies. The assessment of impact magnitude prioritizes sensitivity, project type and size, and pollution thresholds. Additionally, the correlation weights (nil, minimum, medium, maximum) between impact factors and environmental components were also adjusted based on the project's nature and regional conditions. The findings of this study revealed both positive and negative environmental impacts associated with the four case study mines. Decision-makers and stakeholders can utilize this approach in decision making process, advancing sustainable development. With suitable adaptation, this approach can facilitate a rapid and comprehensive assessment of diverse environmental and social impacts associated with various development projects in the country. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.", Coal mine; Environmental impact assessment; Folchi method; Hpakant/ Lonkin gems tract; Limestone mine; Open-pit mining,1.0
676,Examining Catalysts to Optimize Fenton and Photo-Fenton Processes in Wastewater Treatment,"The optimization of Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes for wastewater treatment by examining various catalysts. Existing catalysts used in Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes can suffer from issues such as low activity, sensitivity to reaction conditions, and limited reusability, which hinders their effectiveness and economic viability for large-scale applications. The Objective is to evaluate the performance of different catalysts in Fenton and photo-Fenton processes to identify those that enhance the degradation of target pollutants in wastewater. To optimize the operational parameters such as pH, temperature, and reactant concentrations in conjunction with selected catalysts to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of Fenton and Photo-Fenton reactions. In this proposed approach, the Dual-Phase Catalyst Synthesis and Integrated Batch Experimentation (DPC-SIBE) technique enhances pollutant degradation efficiency by combining solid and photocatalytic components, enabling optimized performance in Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes during wastewater treatment. The Enhanced Electrochemical Fenton (EEF) Process improves pollutant degradation efficiency, reduces chemical handling, and allows real-time monitoring and control in Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes for wastewater treatment. In the Photo-Fenton process, the ultraviolet (UV) light further intensifies the reaction. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is examining catalysts to optimize Fenton and Photo-Fenton processes in wastewater treatment. The result shows that the EEF process, although effective, shows slightly lower removal rates, achieving 90% COD, 80% TOC, and 90% color removal, implemented using Python software. The synergistic effects of UV light in the Photo-Fenton process will be analyzed to determine optimal light wavelengths and intensities that maximize pollutant degradation. Future research on optimizing catalysts in Fenton and photo-Fenton processes can enhance efficiency and sustainability in wastewater treatment. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", ,0.0
677,Assessing the applicability and effectiveness of 3D visualisation in environmental impact assessment,"Computerised 3D models are more intuitive and rich in landscape detail. They are considered an essential visualisation method for the presentation of environmental data with spatial contents. The 3D technology has been increasingly applied in environmental impact assessment (EIA) and urban planning to view and better appreciate human impacts on the environment. Their uses are not restricted to the professionals. Because of their great likeness to the natural world, 3D representations have also been employed to convey information to the general population through public hearings, workshops, and the Internet. The use of 3D visualisation in EIA applications is not without problems, particularly for those without the necessary skills in computer operations and map comprehension. This paper is an assessment of the applicability and effectiveness of 3D visualisation in EIA. First we illustrate different scenarios of 3D portrayals in environmental management. This is followed by a discussion about the problems and concerns of using 3D visualisation in presenting environmental data. These issues are examined in greater detail to highlight various technical considerations and types of data suitable (or not suitable) for the implementation of 3D models. A reference is made to the potential incorporation of feedback mechanisms in a 3D system intended for public participation. © 2010 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.", ,1.0
678,Multi-project environmental impact assessment: insights from offshore oil and gas development in Brazil,"Despite being adopted worldwide, environmental impact assessment (EIA) is under pressure in many countries, while perceived (rightly or wrongly) as an ineffective and inefficient process. Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is thought to help address some of EIA’s shortcomings, but it is absent in many jurisdictions and sectors. In this paper, we argue that multi-project EIA can, in some contexts, simultaneously deliver greater effectiveness and process streamlining. To illustrate our claim, we present a case study from offshore petroleum production in Brazil, where the development of the pre-salt giant reserves is being licensed through a multi-project EIA approach, in a non-SEA planning environment. The analysis provides interesting insights on the strengths and challenges of that strategy, focusing on five aspects of practice: cumulative impacts, efficiency, approach to authorizations, follow-up and political issues. Proper scoping was found to be essential to consistent EIA processes and shorter review times. Finally, we suggest that multi-project EIA approach should be revisited by practitioners and regulators to identify opportunities for deployment, especially in jurisdictions where strategic assessments are not in place. © 2018, © 2018 IAIA.", cumulative effects assessment; effectiveness; Environmental impact assessment (EIA); multi-project (EIA); offshore oil and gas; scoping,1.0
679,"Cytotoxicity effects of water dispersible oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes on marine alga, Dunaliella tertiolecta","The multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are novel materials with many potential applications. The ecotoxicity of these materials is not well studied, but it is essential for environmental impact assessments. In this study a commercially available MWNT material was carboxylated by microwave assisted acid oxidation. This functionalized MWNT (f-MWNT) material was examined for toxicity effects using unicellular marine green alga Dunaliella tertiolecta. D. tertiolecta was exposed to f-MWNT which had been pre-equilibrated with culture media for 24 h. Substantial growth lag phase was observed at 5 and 10mgL-1 f-MWNT, and the resulting 50% effective concentration (EC50) on 96-h growth was 0.82±0.08mgL-1. During mid-exponential growth phase cytotoxicity was evidenced at 10mgL-1 f-MWNT in 36% reduction in exponential growth rate, 88mV more positive glutathione redox potential (indicative of oxidative stress), 5% and 22% reduction in photosystem II (PSII) quantum yield and functional cross section respectively, all relative to the control cultures. However, when the large f-MWNT aggregates in the media with 10mgL-1 f-MWNT were removed by 0.2μm filtration, D. tertiolecta did not show significant cytotoxicity effects in any of the above parameters. This suggests that the cytotoxicity effects originated predominately from the large f-MWNT aggregates. Analysis of the f-MWNT aggregation dynamics suggests active interaction between f-MWNT and algal cells or cell metabolites that promoted f-MWNT aggregation formation. The f-MWNT particles were also found absorbed on algal cell surface. The direct contact between f-MWNT and cell surface was likely responsible for reduced PSII functional cross section and oxidative stress during exponential growth. © 2010.", Aggregates; Ecotoxicity; Glutathione; Marine algae; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes; Nanoparticles; Photosystem II; Seawater,0.0
680,Reconstructing long term annual deforestation dynamics in Pará and Mato Grosso using the Landsat archive,"Remote sensing based monitoring of deforestation in the tropics is crucial to better understand global land use change and related changes in ecosystem service provision and to inform governments and civil society on the effectiveness their forest protection policies. In Brazil, deforestation has been closely coupled to the expansion of grazing and cropping systems primarily in the tropical forest, but no spatially explicit high resolution database on deforestation exists that captures tropical forest clearing prior to 2000. The open Landsat archive provides >45 years of imagery and is well suited for wall-to-wall assessments of historic deforestation dynamics which are valuable to policy development and environmental impact assessments. Image analysis procedures for reconstructing long-term deforestation dynamics over large areas need to cope with regions and time periods for which the archive contains heterogeneous data densities on a yearly and decadal basis. We create for the first time yearly 30 m maps of long term, annual deforestation dynamics (LTAD) covering the period from 1984 to 2014 for Pará and Mato Grosso, two Brazilian federal states that cover much of the Brazilian arc-of-deforestation. Our results provide valuable insights into historic deforestation trends, with annually increasing deforestation from 1990 to 1999 for both Pará and Mato Grosso. Peak deforestation occurred in 2004 after which deforestation leveled off – with a more pronounced decrease in Mato Grosso than in Pará. Contrary to Mato Grosso, Pará again experienced increasing annual forest clearing in recent years. For the time period after 2000, we provide an in-depth comparison with two widely used products, the Brazilian PRODES and the Global Forest Change maps (GFC, Hansen et al., 2013). Our deforestation estimates (407,000 ± 42,000 km2 at 95% confidence level) are above those provided by PRODES, while GFC results are closer to our estimates for the comparison period. Recent PRODES estimates are consistently below our and the GFC results. Overall, our results exemplify the potential of open image archives for multi-decadal, wall-to-wall and fine grain reconstruction of forest change. The presented approach prototypes similar assessments of tropical forest dynamics globally faced with issues of data scarcity. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.", Amazon; Brazil; Compositing; Deforestation; Landsat; LGAC; Random Forest; Time series,0.0
681,Investigating the implementation of the mitigation hierarchy approach in environmental impact assessment in relation to biodiversity impacts,"Global loss of biodiversity has directly and indirectly been caused by human activities. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) attempts to address the loss of biodiversity caused by development projects, by avoiding, reducing or compensating the loss (in that order following the mitigation hierarchy approach). Evidence suggests that in practice the mitigation hierarchy is not always applied correctly, and that monitoring is frequently absent, or flawed, meaning that the success of the mitigation measures, and their associated biodiversity outcomes, remain unknown. However, there is no literature that has systematically examined the application of the mitigation hierarchy and assessed the effectiveness of associated monitoring in an EIA system. This study fills that gap using Chile as an example because of its high biodiversity setting, and ease of access to EIA-related data. The results indicate that the use of compensation measures exceeded what would be expected from correct implementation of the mitigation hierarchy, and that there was also some misclassification of the measures. Monitoring studies focused on inspecting implementation of mitigation measures rather than measuring biodiversity outcomes (meaning that mitigation effectiveness cannot be fully evaluated). Further, there was a focus on specific elements of ecosystems and lack of consideration for broader biodiversity implications. Thus, the findings raise some concerns over the ability of EIA to achieve its goals of zero net loss of biodiversity. We make suggestions to improve the mitigation and monitoring aspects of the EIA process in Chile and would suggest that the recommendations are likely to have wider relevance to other jurisdictions. © 2023 The Authors", Biodiversity outcome; Chile; Environmental impact assessment; Mitigation hierarchy; Monitoring; No net loss biodiversity,1.0
682,Resolving the landfill siting impasse: modelling technocratic and indigenous perspectives using GIS multicriteria approach,"Increase in waste generation calls for an effective waste management as this has become a necessity for environmental sustainability. Several methods are adopted in managing waste, which include waste reduction, reuse, thermal treatment, recycling and landfilling. The landfill method is recognised as the most used of all the waste management methods in developing countries such as Ghana. However, the selection of a suitable landfill site is very difficult and tedious. This is because it involves a consideration of many factors such as environmental, topographic, economic, socio-cultural and civil engineering. This research sought to identify a suitable landfill site by applying GIS multicriteria and weighted overlay approach in the Bongo District of Northern Ghana. The analysis relied on criteria and weights provided by the technocrats and the indigenes in the district as a way of demonstrating how landfill siting impasse can be resolved by incorporating the various stakeholders. The results obtained provided clear areas for landfill sites in the study area from the technocratic and the indigenous perspectives. However, the technocratic perspective failed to include an important cultural criterion, sacred groves, as a factor. The indigenous perspective also compromised on the factor related to nearness to residential areas, and is equally not sufficient on its own. The optimal landfill sites, which meets the expectations of both the technocrats and indigenes, was identified. This perspective has produced technically favourable and socio-culturally acceptable landfill site. However, it is recommended an environmental impact assessment (EIA) be conducted to identify the full environmental and social cost of the site. It is concluded that in landfill site selection much attention be given to cultural factors in the same way as the technical factors. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.", GIS; Infrastructural planning; Landfill site; Multicriteria analysis; Weighted overlay,1.0
683,The obligation to undertake an environmental assessment in the jurisprudence of the ICJ: A principle in search of autonomy,"The practice of carrying out an environmental impact assessment (EIA) has gained strength in international law and jurisprudence, finding application in the case law of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). If, on the one hand, the ICJ has recognized the customary nature of this principle, on the other its application poses a set of challenges, mainly linked to the autonomy of this obligation from other international environmental law norms. More precisely, the obligation at issue has been applied in connection with the due diligence and notification principles, creating uncertainty about its scope, as well as about its substantive or procedural nature. Likewise, the autonomy of the obligation to perform an EIA has been challenged in relation to the definition of the content and scope of the obligation itself, which in turn is linked to the existence of applicable treaty provisions or of soft law. This article discusses the impact of these elements on the reasoning of the Court in the cases at issue, in order to demonstrate how such lack of autonomy can undermine the coherence of the reasoning itself and, therefore, an effective application of the principle. © Cambridge University Press.", ,1.0
684,A framework on public participation practice for environmental impact assessment (Eia) in malaysia: A conceptual paper,"Elements of public participation are embedded in the Malaysian EIA process. Nonetheless, the evidences of effective public participation for EIA in Malaysia have remained scant. The inadequacies in the requirement and legislations on public participation for EIA have resulted to barriers that hinder quality public participation. Thus, recommendations to further improve the application of public participation for EIA in Malaysia are required. Therefore, this research aims to develop a framework on public participation practice for EIA in Malaysia utilizing four research objectives. The four research objectives are to identify the requirements and legislation on public participation practice for EIA, to analyze the barriers on public participation practice for EIA, to analyze the recommendations to improve public participation practice for EIA and to propose a framework on public participation practice for EIA. A mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods were adapted for this research utilizing questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews as the research instruments. Data were collected from three groups of respondents consisted of EIA consultants, environmental NGOs and DOE officers.

685,Analysis on source control of health risk in planning environmental impact assessment; [规划环境影响评价中开展健康风险源头控制],"Planning environmental impact assessment (PEIA) has been one of the most important source control measures to prevent the environmental risk. However, the current practice of PEIA lacks the health risk assessment index system, and thus weaks its integrity and effectiveness greatly. Compared to the traditional four-step health risk assessment procedure, environmental planning health risk assessment (EPHRA) has more implications, which not only interacts with the environmental planning, but also owns systematic, contextual, and reverse restriction to the environmental planning. The core objective of EPHRA is to design greener, and more environmentally friendly and reasonable industrial structures and systems through scientific and systemic environmental health impact assessment. Based on the core index of health risk tolerance, it aims at providing suitable guide to the health protection by adjusting the spatial layout and the emission limitation for the risk sources through the scenario analysis of health benefit and loss and the projection of industrial development. To make up the ""gap"" of health index missing of EPHRA, itwas suggested that EPHRA technique should be developed as soon as possible, and EPHRA technical guidelines and specifications be promoted, so as to ensure the effective practice of the mandatory health constraints on PEIA. © 2020 Journal of Environmental Engineering Technology.

686,An LCA study of an electricity coal supply chain,"Purpose: The aim of this paper is to provide methods to find the emission source and estimate the amount of waste gas emissions in the electricity coal supply chain, establish the model of the environmental impact (burden) in the electricity coal supply chain, detect the critical factor which causes significant environmental impact, and then identify the key control direction and reduce amount of environmental pollution in the electricity coal supply chain. Design/methodology/approach: In this context, life cycle inventory and life cycle assessment of China's electricity coal were established in three difference stages: coal mining, coal transportation, and coal burning. Then the outcomes were analyzed with the aim to reduce waste gases emissions' environmental impact in the electricity coal supply chain from the perspective of sensitivity analysis. Findings: The results and conclusion are as follow: (1) In terms of total waste gas emissions in electricity coal supply chain, CO2 is emitted in the greatest quantity, accounting for 98-99 wt% of the total waste gas emissions. The vast majority of the CO2, greater than 93%, is emitted from the power plant when the coal is combusted. (2) Other than CO2, the main waste gas is CH4, SO2 and so on. CH4 is mainly emitted from Coal Bed Methane (CBM), so the option is to consider capturing some of the CH4 from underground mines for an alternative use. SO2 is mainly emitted from power plant when the coal is combusted. (3) The environmental burden of coal burning subsystem is greatest, followed by the coal mining subsystem, and finally the coal transportation subsystem. Improving the coal-burning efficiency of coal-fired power plant in electricity coal supply chain is the most effective way to reduce the environmental impact of waste gas emissions. (4) Of the three subsystems examined (coal mining, coal transportation, and coal burning), transportation requires the fewest resources and has the lowest waste gas emissions. However, the energy consumption for this subsystem is significant (excluding the mine mouth case), and transportation distance is found to have a substantial effect on the oil consumption and non-coal energy consumption. (5) In electricity coal supply chain, the biggest environmental impact of waste gas emissions is GWP, followed by EP, AP, POCP and ODP, and regional impact is greater than the global impact. Practical implications: The model and methodology established in this paper could be used for environmental impact assessment of waste gas emissions in electricity coal supply chain and sensitivity analysis in China, and it could supply reference and example for similar researches. The data information on life cycle inventory, impact assessment and sensitivity analysis could supply theory and data reference for waste gas emissions control in electricity coal supply chain. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to study the environmental influence of electricity coal supply chain by employing a LCA approach from life cycle of electricity coal.", Electricity coal supply chain; Life cycle assessment; Sensitivity analysis,0.0

The paper starts with a partial analysis of the existing legal norms related to mining and processing of mineral resources. Next, it analyses mineral resource mining options free of negative environmental impacts. The fundamental tool to assess potential environmental impacts of mining is the implementation of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process for a given mineral resource. In the Czech Republic environmental impact assessment is carried out by course of Act 100/2001 Coll. Its important amendment is Act 39/2015 Coll. claiming, inter alia, that the environmental impact assessment is rigidly connected with other permits and procedures, such as the zoning process and building construction permits.

689,Incorporating climate change mitigation and adaptation into environmental impact assessment: a review of current practice within transport projects in England,"Climate change mitigation and adaptation can be perceived as neglected in environmental impact assessment (EIA). In the light of amendments to the European Union EIA Directive (2014), we developed a novel criteria-based review package to assess climate change mitigation and adaptation as documented in environmental statements, and applied this to a sample of 10 transport developments from England. Justifications relating to climate policy, climate science, the effect of climate change on the development and its vulnerability to climate risks were well explained in most projects. Many projects lacked detail of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures and their benefits, whilst evidence of commitment to mitigation and adaptation or to post-decision monitoring was poor or non-existent; reportedly due to costs, time constraints and absence of mandatory requirements. It is recommended that to improve the effectiveness of the consideration of climate change mitigation and adaptation in EIA, the production of guidelines, change of behaviour of EIA practitioners, more holistic consideration of climate change issues, rigorous post-decision monitoring and use of climate change terminology are more widely adopted. © 2016 IAIA.", Adaptation; climate change; mitigation; review; transport projects,1.0
690,"Sustainable development of ""Smixi"" using environmental impact assessment","The contribution of the forest of Smixi's area to the quality of life is unlimited, as it corresponds quantitively or qualitively to the needs of the inhabitants and the visitors. It is well known that the public demand for quality recreation areas is increasing rapidly because of the fast-growing seasonal population and the improvement of its citizens' income levels. The accessibility, the improvement and the quality of the forest should be one of the first priorities of the office of forestry and the municipality of Grevena. It is also necessary to enhance the level of environmental education, especially of the young, in order for the recreation areas and especially the environment to be appreciated and respected. This research develops a method to evaluate the impacts of forest road and path construction on the natural environment. The method will be used to improve the layout of forest roads and paths at an early planning stage. The method which was applied has been practical, effective and easy to use before the road or path construction. The criteria to assess the environmental impact was identified and rated by interviewing Greek forest scientists using questionnaires. A threshold will be defined for the level of compatible impacts. Road or path segments exceeding this threshold will be identified for re-design purposes to minimize negative impact on the environment. The combination will be used as a decision-support tool together with the Environmental Impact Assessment parameters, cost, existing legislation and environmental policy. Only in this way can we effectively use the forest benefits. This can contribute to an improvement in public health (both mental and emotional); a service which nowadays is scarce and not adequately appreciated. © 2007 WIT Press.", E.I.A.; Forest roads and paths; Recreation evaluation; Smixi; Sustainable development,1.0
691,Testing a new classification of morphological functional groups of marine macroalgae for the detection of responses to stress,"Morpho-functional group classifications have been widely used in studies concerning benthic macroalgal communities, due to their easy application and the reduced cost and workload compared with species-level identifications. However, their effectiveness in representing spatio-temporal patterns and describing the effect of disturbances has been disputed. We propose a new, expanded classification of morphological functional groups based on thallus structure, growth form, branching pattern, and taxonomic affinities. This approach was tested on subtidal macroalgal assemblages of the western Mediterranean. We examined the differences in composition of assemblages subjected to different types of stressors using species, traditional morphological groups, and new morphological groups. Results showed that the new morphological groups allowed to detect patterns highlighted through species analyses generally better than the use of traditional morpho-functional groups. The new morphological groups may represent a valid tool in monitoring programs and environmental impact assessments, where it is important to detect early stages of environmental changes using methods that allow to examine a large number of samples in a limited time. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.", ,1.0

693,Addressing environmental impact assessment challenges in Pacific island countries for effective management of deep sea minerals activities,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an important instrument for management of deep sea minerals (DSM) activities in the Pacific islands region. However, effective EIA application is likely to be impeded by four challenges common among Pacific island countries: (1) human resource shortfalls; (2) insufficient quality control exercised over EIA reports; (3) weak compliance monitoring and enforcement; and (4) low levels of public engagement and participation in EIA. This paper identifies options for addressing the challenges, to improve EIA implementation and to ensure DSM activities are subject to appropriate regulation and oversight. Risks may be faced if the challenges are not addressed, including, failure to meet environmental management and governance obligations; loss of confidence in the regulatory system; environmental harm; and discouragement of sustainable development and investment. Pacific island countries that choose to engage with the DSM sector must apply EIA rigorously and continually work at improving their EIA systems, if they seek to maximise positive development outcomes and to minimise adverse effects on other marine users and values. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd", Deep sea minerals; Environmental impact assessment; Multilateral environmental agreements; Pacific island countries,1.0

We focused on procedural aspects of environmental justice and concentrated specifically on public interest litigation. Using a qualitative case study (document review, semi-structured interviews, participant observation, transect walks, thematic analysis), we examined conflict and litigation in an EIA of a proposed industrial development affecting a wetland and agricultural livelihoods in the state of Gujarat. The study 1) describes aspects of the EIA that triggered opposition, including litigation before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), 2) explains the extent to which the EIA addressed concerns of potentially affected local communities, and 3) assesses the effectiveness of the court system and the NGT in resolving disputes arising from the EIA. We found: that important gaps in the EIA report and lack of public participation opportunities were important triggers for litigation; crucial disconnects between issues addressed in the EIA and concerns of affected communities; and formidable challenges to gaining full access to legal representation, technical expertise and judicial remedies. Addressing these shortcomings would improve the EIA regime, enhance procedural aspects of environmental justice in India, and improve the prospects for distributive, recognitional and restorative justice by ensuring that EIAs reflect local knowledge, values and aspirations. © 2019, © 2019 IAIA.", cement production; green bench; limestone mining; National Green Tribunal (NGT); Nirma Ltd; wetland conservation,1.0

The implementation of the Environmental Impact Assessment Law of the People's Republic of China in 2003 established the legal status of EIA as an environmental management system, which is a milestone in the development of China's EIA system. In the twenty years since the EIA Law was implemented, China's EIA system has achieved rapid development from project EIA to planning EIA, and then to large regional strategic EIA and policy EIA. Based on the research and practice progress of the EIA system, the identification of the existing deficiencies is helpful to provide a reference for the development of China's EIA system in the next stage. Firstly, the development of the EIA system was reviewed, and then the research progress of China's EIA system in the past 20 years was summarized and hot spots analyzed based on the method of bibliometrics and visual analysis. Combined with the analysis results, the practice progress of China's EIA system was summarized. Finally, some suggestions were provided including strengthening the cohesion between the EIA system and the pollutant discharge permit system, strengthening the supervision in process and afterwards, improving the legal position of planning EIA, strengthening the development of policy EIA and improving the effectiveness of public participation, to further improve the effectiveness of China's EIA system, and achieve sustainable improvement of ecological environment quality and high-quality economic development. © 2022 Editorial Department of Journal of Southern Medical University.", environmental impact assessment; environmental impact assessment law; planning environmental impact assessment; reform; strategic environmental impact assessment,1.0
697,Treatment of biodiversity issues in impact assessment of electricity power transmission lines: A Finnish case review,"The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process concerning the route of a 400 kV power transmission line between Loviisa and Hikiä in southern Finland was reviewed in order to assess how biodiversity issues are treated and to provide suggestions on how to improve the effectiveness of treatment of biodiversity issues in impact assessment of linear development projects. The review covered the whole assessment process, including interviews of stakeholders, participation in the interest group meetings and review of all documents from the project. The baseline studies and assessment of direct impacts in the case study were detailed but the documentation, both the assessment programme and the assessment report, only gave a partial picture of the assessment process. All existing information, baseline survey and assessment methods should be addressed in the scoping phase in order to promote interaction between all stakeholders. In contrast to the assessment of the direct effects, which first emphasized impacts on the nationally important and protected flying squirrel but later expanded to deal with the assessment of impacts on ecologically important sites, the indirect and cumulative impacts of the power line were poorly addressed. The public was given the opportunity to become involved in the EIA process. However, they were more concerned with impacts on their properties and less so on biodiversity and species protection issues. This suggests that the public needs to become more informed about locally important features of biodiversity. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

698,Bridging the gap between reliable data collection and the environmental impact for mechanised field operations,"Mechanisation is related to an important proportion of the environmental impacts associated with agriculture, mainly due to engine fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions, and materials production, use and disposal. Despite standardised and extensively accepted methods for environmental impact assessment have been developed, their application to mechanical field operations is still limited. In absence of reliable data, the reductions in environmental impact that are achievable cannot be easily evaluated by studying machinery already available on the market and more suitable machinery or by selecting the proper coupling between the implement and the tractor. This study carries out a comparative Life cycle assessment (LCA) of a rotary harrowing operation using different data sources. Data was gathered from: (i) Ecoinvent database, (ii) ENVIAM, a tool developed to support the completion of inventories for agricultural machinery varying the local pedo-climatic, operating and mechanical features, and (iii) primary data directly collected during experimental tests with CAN-bus, GPS and exhaust gases analyser. The analysis showed that using database average data, the resulting environmental load is not always reliable and, in this particular study, it consistently overestimated most outcomes. Moreover, by processing primary data collected using modern technology, the operation could be split in different working phases (effective work, turns, stationary-idling). Thus, specific mechanical features were quantified and this permitted the environmental impact to be evaluated with more detail. © 2017 IAgrE", CAN-bus; Gas analyser; Harrowing; Inventory filling; Life cycle assessment; Primary data,0.0
699,"Systematic environmental impact assessment for non-natural reserve areas: A case study of the chaishitan water conservancy project on land use and plant diversity in Yunnan, China","Environmental impact assessment (EIA) before and after the establishment of a Water Conservancy Project (WCP) is of great theoretical and practical importance for assessing the effectiveness of ecological restoration efforts. WCPs rehabilitate flood-damaged areas or other regions hit by disasters by controlling and redistributing surface water and groundwater. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) and Composite Evaluation Index (CEI) in predictive modeling, we studied the degree to which a WCP could change land use, plant communities, and species diversity in Yunnan, China. Via modeling, we quantified likely landscape pattern changes and linked them to naturality (i.e., the percentage of secondary vegetation types), diversity, and stability together with the human interferences (e.g., conservation or restoration project) of an ecosystem. The value of each index was determined by the evaluation system, and the weight percentage was decided through Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). We found that minor land-use changes would occur after the Chaishitan WCP was theoretically established. The greatest decline was farmland (0.079%), followed by forest (0.066%), with the least decline in water bodies (0.020%). We found 1,076 vascular plant species (including subspecies, varieties and form) belonging to 165 families and 647 genera in Chaishitan irrigation area before the water conservancy establishment. The naturality and diversity decreased 11.18 and 10.16% respectively. The CEI was 0.92, which indicated that Chaishitan WCP will enhance local landscape heterogeneity, and it will not deteriorate local ecological quality. Our study proposes a comprehensive ecological evaluation system for this WCP and further suggests the importance of including the ecological and environmental consequences of the WCP, along with the well-established socioeconomic evaluation systems for non-natural reserve areas. We conclude that the Chaishitan WCP will have minor environmental impacts on the local landscape and plant diversity. Furthermore, the irrigation project will provide sufficient water once established, which will enrich local plant diversity; therefore, we support its construction. © 2017 Zhu, Zhao, Lin, Qureshi, Ross Friedman, Cai and Wang.", Ecological evaluation; Landscape index; Modeling; Plant diversity; Water conservancy project,1.0
700,Capacity building and technology transfer for improving governance of marine areas both beyond and within national jurisdiction,"Capacity building and technology transfer (CBTT) are vital for the success of a new international legally-binding agreement for marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction. Without effective CBTT, many developing countries are unlikely to be able to fulfill their obligations in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ), including by undertaking area-based management, evaluating environmental impact assessments, and benefiting from the utilization of marine genetic resources – or to realize their rights. Meanwhile, several other international commitments require varying forms of CBTT at global, regional and national levels. This article analyses areas where synergies are possible for implementing CBTT, and those where additional, ABNJ-related capacities will need to be mainstreamed for holistic ocean management. We argue that CBTT is more meaningful, effective and resource-efficient if it corresponds to the ecological realities of an interconnected ocean by linking initiatives relating to ABNJ with those within national jurisdiction. We discuss why and how CBTT is also more useful on the national level if it maximizes synergies between international policies and agreements, and allows countries to concurrently participate in a BBNJ agreement and fulfill national priorities related to sustainable development, for example by enhancing livelihoods, eradicating hunger and poverty, and building capacity for science and innovation as part of national blue economies based on healthy ocean ecosystems.

Effective environmental impact assessment requires the use of sound scientific information. This paper presents the results of studies that have assessed the adequacy of the use of science in environmental impact assessment in the US. Most of the studies have criticized documents produced by environmental impact assessment as being deficient in sound scientific information.

704,Energy system optimization based on fuzzy decision support system and unstructured data,"To address the complex challenges in energy systems, this study proposes a novel optimization framework that integrates fuzzy decision support and unstructured data processing technologies. This framework aims to improve efficiency, reduce costs, decrease environmental impact, increase system flexibility, and enhance user satisfaction, thereby promoting sustainable development in the energy industry. The framework combines the innovative Energy Semantic Mapping Model (ESMM) and the advanced deep learning architecture ResNet to process textual and visual data effectively. ESMM enables accurate prediction of energy demand, while ResNet significantly reduces equipment maintenance costs and improves energy distribution efficiency. These advancements are critical as they address the limitations of existing approaches in handling large-scale unstructured data and making informed decisions under uncertainty. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) confirms the model's effectiveness in reducing carbon emissions. A comprehensive economic analysis demonstrates substantial cost savings in energy procurement and operations and maintenance, with overall savings exceeding 25%. Enhanced user satisfaction and reduced system response times further validate the practical utility of the proposed approach. Additionally, a genetic algorithm is used to optimize the fuzzy rule base, enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the model. Experimental results show superior performance compared to traditional systems, providing strong empirical evidence for the intelligent transformation of energy systems. This research contributes to the field by offering a more sophisticated and flexible solution for managing energy systems, particularly in terms of leveraging unstructured data and improving decision-making processes. © The Author(s) 2024.", Energy system; Fuzzy decision support system; System optimization; Unstructured data,1.0
705,The potential utility of rodents and other small mammals as indicators of ecosystem 'integrity' of South African grasslands,"Context The expansive grassland biome is one of the most extensively transformed in South Africa, yet no strategy for monitoring its integrity is in place. A grassland health program, incorporating different ecosystem levels, was recently initiated. The suitability of three taxonomic groups as indicators has been tested so far: vegetation (by calculating an ecological index value, El), insects (using the South African grassland scoring system, SAGraSS) and small mammals (this study). All of these methods aim to be rapid and easy to perform. Whereas SAGraSS still needs further refinement, several factors already indicate the importance of including small mammal community parameters in integrity assessments. Aims This contribution reports on more than 12 years of results from various studies on small mammals in the Free State Grasslands, with the aim of exploring the utility of small mammal survey for assessment of ecosystem integrity. Methods The hypothesis was based on the outcomes of several short-term studies conducted in the grassland biome. Combining all previous results, this paper re-evaluates the parameters of trap success, species richness, diversity, evenness and individual species as bio-indicators. Key results By combining data from many sites and years, the effect of seasonal and inter-annual variations in habitat and population parameters was diminished, and a more general picture of small mammal community structure revealed. New insights were gleaned into the status of several indicator species. By providing a summary of small mammal community parameter scores and indices, the study establishes a benchmark for future small mammal assessments and monitoring. To be effective, small mammal surveys in the grassland biome of southern Africa should be carried out in autumn and early winter. Conclusions This study suggests that small mammal species richness and diversity decline with habitat degradation; that the generalist rodent Mastomys coucha dominates community numbers at low ecological integrity; that the number of specialist species increases towards ecological climax; and that specific species act as indicators during the successional process. Implications This study should benefit the monitoring, conservation and management of grassland ecosystems, make environmental impact assessments more effective, and identify new topics for ecological research. © 2011 CSIRO.", community structure; diversity; ecological integrity; species richness,1.0
706,Life Cycle Costing and Assessment of Building Slab Materials,"The selection process of material for slab construction must be well guided to ensure an effective and efficient slab. While numerous alternatives can be selected, some materials remain the dominant choice in the Nigerian construction industry. The usage of Concrete is now competing with eco-friendly materials such as Polystyrene and Hollow clay pot. This study researches into the life cycle cost of the three materials to determine the material with the lowest life cycle cost. It also assesses the environmental impacts posed by the production of the materials to the society. Cost data were retrieved from Design documents, Documented Bid Records, Bills of Quantities, Current documented prices, Maintenance schedules, and Slab Performance Models. Environmental Impact Assessment, structured interview, and Questionnaires were the collection instruments used to obtain assessment data. The analysis involved NPV discounting, Shadow pricing techniques, Sensitivity analysis, Descriptive statistics and Mean item scoring. The research discovered that although Concrete poses less cost on the slab users, Hollow clay pot slab possesses the lowest life cycle cost and differs from Polystyrene with a very close margin of less than 10%. Major environmental impacts posed by the production of the materials were air pollution, badlands due to excessive mining, gas flaring, and environmental waste. The study then recommends that Hollow clay pot and Polystyrene serve as a better alternative for the commonly used Concrete and should, therefore, be adopted for slab construction. © 2019, Kare Publishing.

707,Muddied waters: Revealing methodological confusion in Australia’s environmental impact assessment process,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a tool which identifies and evaluates the likely impacts of a development project on the environment, economy and society. It forms an integral part of the regulatory framework of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act). There appears to be, however, an issue which is undermining EIA’s intended purposes to facilitate informed decision-making and achieve the environmental objectives of the EPBC Act: the methodological clarity of EIA. Currently, there is no widely accepted method for assessing environmental and economic impacts. This study exposes the methodological confusion in the assessment of environmental and economic impacts of mining projects assessed under the EPBC Act and analyses the implications of this issue for EIA’s ability to achieve its intended purposes. The article concludes that failure by the legislature to address methodological confusion risks undermining the legitimacy and effectiveness of EIA in Australia. © 2020, Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Ltd.

708,Encouraging proactive governance of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction through Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA),"The international legal agreement on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction (the BBNJ Agreement) currently being developed by the United Nations will be the foundation for conservation and sustainable use of these marine areas for the foreseeable future. As presently formulated the draft text seems more oriented to a reactive approach, based on the use of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to respond to proposals rather than proactively pursuing what needs to be done to ensure sustainability of ocean ecosystems in ABNJ. In this paper we argue that a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) process could transform the way that the BBNJ agreement approaches conservation and sustainable use. By conceptualising SEA as a process designed to facilitate strategic thinking it can facilitate a proactive approach to ecosystem function conservation and enable transitions toward sustainability. We outline and describe a SEA process that could be incorporated into the BBNJ Agreement. This process would be consistent with the currently proposed structure of the Agreement and the EIA process that is currently envisaged. The proposed process comprises two interacting tracks of SEA and Marine Protected Area/Area-based Management Tool (MPA/ABMT) development. The process would also facilitate engagement of the full range of regional and global stakeholders required for effective governance of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (ABNJ). © 2021 The Authors", ABNJ; EIA; Marine biodiversity; Marine protected areas; Ocean governance,1.0
709,Constructing a paradigm of environmental impact assessment under the new era of ecological civilization in China,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) paradigm comprises the beliefs generally accepted and followed by the scientific community, the research on discipline theories and dominant methods jointly promoted and formed, the institutional arrangements commonly observed, and the practical activities generated. Based on defining the connotation of the EIA paradigm and the interrelationship among its elements, this study analyzes the development of the EIA paradigm over the past 40 years, according to the leading force of institution formation and change, divides it into three stages: the initial stage (from early 1970s to early 1990s), the strengthening stage (from early 1990s to 2015), and the reform stage (since 2015). Afterward, the problems faced after the reform of the EIA are summarized from the EIA paradigm's belief, theory, institution, and practice. Under the new era of ecological civilization in China, EIA's value, disciplinary, institutional, and practical attributes should achieve effective interaction.

712,Implications of recent EIA changes in Thailand,"The practice of environmental impact assessment (EIA) was implemented in Thailand after the revision of the National Environmental Quality Act in 1978. This led to more than 3000 EIA documents being prepared and officially submitted up to 1992. More recently, a new act, the Enhancement and Conservation of National Environmental Quality Act, was introduced in 1992. As a consequence, some aspects of environmental legislation have been improved including the EIA process, which is expected to be more effective under the new act. This article examines the development and implementation of the EIA process in Thailand and its effectiveness in the context of its performance as an environmental management tool. The strengths and weaknesses of the EIA process under the original act are analyzed and compared to the new act, using two case studies in order to gain an insight into the EIA system. The first is the Second Stage Expressway in Bangkok, and the second is the Pak Mun Hydroelectric Dam project in Ubon Rachathani, a north-eastern province of Thailand. EIAs for these projects were originally submitted according to the requirements of the old act. Both are public projects that have aroused controversy for different environmental reasons, although final decisions have been made facilitating the implementation of these projects. Finally, the article presents some suggestions for improving the content and procedures for the EIA system in Thailand. © 1994.", ,1.0
713,"Toward a land zoning negotiation support platform: "" Tips and tricks"" for participatory land use planning in Laos","Managing complex landscape mosaics in areas dominated by poverty often requires addressing conflicting objectives and managing trade-offs, such as that between maintaining/enhancing ecological functions and improving livelihoods. Laos, like many other developing countries dependent on agriculture and natural resources for the subsistence of a mostly rural population, has used land use planning (LUP) as a core policy instrument to achieve sustainable development. However, previous reviews of LUP implementation showed large discrepancies between policies and practices and between the intended goals and actual outcomes. There is a need for increased participation, improved integration of scales, harmonization of superimposed plans, and enhanced coordination between implementing agencies and other stakeholders. Consequently, former normative approaches to LUP have been gradually replaced (at least on paper) by a new paradigm. Participatory land use planning (PLUP) has recently become a central element of donor-supported programs in developing countries. However, despite the good intentions of PLUP principles, implementation remains entangled with confused practical issues that compromise effective participation. As an alternative to complex, technologically sophisticated LUP models that local stakeholders cannot use or replicate, a communication platform supporting negotiations among multiple stakeholder groups was tested in a village cluster in Luang Prabang Province in northern Laos. This innovative approach, based on a combination of role-playing games, participatory 3D modeling, GIS, and socioeconomic and environmental impact assessment, allows stakeholders to collectively explore the consequences of land use decisions and choose between alternative future landscapes. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.", Boundary objects; Communication platform; Laos; Participatory land use planning,1.0

A high proportion (50%) of suggested mitigation measures were not translated into planning conditions or obligations. However, a significant number of additional conditions or obligations, not directly based on the ES, were imposed on developers. The research suggests a mismatch between the practice of those producing ESs and the expectations of planning authorities, leading to inefficiency and, possibly, emasculation of environmental impact assessment through a failure to implement mitigation.

Therefore, this study examines a socio-economic assessment in the environmental impact statements (EIS) and the perceptions of the EIA experts towards a socio economic assessment. Although formally a socio-economic assessment has been validated only recently, 30% of specialists claimed having conducted a socio-economic assessment in detail prior to the amendments to the law. Thus, the EIS analysis has shown a rather poor consideration of these issues as mainly creation of work places was addressed. The survey has shown that preparation of the EIA documents after the formalisation of a socio-economic assessment would change mainly nominally. The EIA experts working in the private sector were more optimistic than those from state institutions. Reluctance of changes and personal attitudes have to be addressed, especially those particular to the experts of state institutions. In addition, methodological guidance, integrative approach and public involvement into the decision-making process could change the current situation and increase the effectiveness of the EIA process and the social impact assessment in general. © 2015 Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press.", environmental impact assessment; Lithuania; social impact assessment; socio-economic assessment,1.0
716,Modeling Li isotope fractionation during the coal-combustion process and evaluating its capacity as an environmental tracer,"Coal-fired power plants (CFPPs) utilizing lithium-rich coal are significant sources of anthropogenic Li emissions, highlighting the importance of effective tracing of potentially toxic Li for environmental monitoring and regulation. Lithium isotopes are a promising tracer, yet the dynamics of isotopic behavior during coal combustion are not well understood. This study investigates the elemental and isotopic behavior of Li in feed coals and combustion products from two pulverized coal-fired boilers (PC-H and PC-X) and one circulating fluidized bed boiler (CFB-H). The results showed that Li was primarily captured in fly ash (66.4 % to 84.8 %), with a fraction (1.3 % to 25.2 %) emitted into the atmosphere (stack emission). The isotopic composition of Li in feed coal ranged from −0.6 ‰ to +0.3 ‰, contrasting with δ7Li values in bottom ash and fly ash, which range from −2.7 ‰ to +0.1 ‰ and − 1.9 ‰ to +0.5 ‰, respectively. Notably, bottom ash samples consistently exhibit lower δ7Li values than their corresponding feed coal, suggesting the volatilization of heavier Li isotopes during combustion. Mass balance calculations reveal that stack emissions are enriched in heavier isotopes, with δ7Li values reaching up to +17.8 ‰. A Rayleigh fractionation model, with a fractionation factor of α = 1.0044, indicates that light lithium isotopes preferentially condense onto fly ash, while heavier isotopes are predominantly found in stack emissions. This model provides a quantitative framework for understanding isotopic segregation during cooling, significantly advancing methodologies for tracing and quantifying Li emissions for environmental impact assessments and source attribution of anthropogenic Li from CFPPs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.", Coal-fired pollutants; Coal-fired power plants; Emission model; Isotope fractionation; Lithium,0.0
717,Evolution of environmental impact assessment as applied to watershed modification projects in Canada,"This article reviews the application of environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures and practices to three watershed modification projects situaled in western Canada. These ventures were justified for accelerating regional economic development, and cover the period during which public concerns for protecting the environment rapidly made their way into the national political agenda. An historical account and analysis of the situation, therefore, seems desirable in order to understand the development of EIA processes, practices, and methodologies since the start of construction of the first project in 1961. This study concludes that there has been good progress in predicting and evaluating environmental and related social impacts of watershed modification proposals. However, a number of obstacles need to be overcome before EIA can firmly establish itself as an effective planning tool. These difficulties include jurisdictional confusions and conflicts, division of authority and responsibility in designing and implementing appropriate mitigative and monitoring measures, lack of tested EIA methodologies, and limited availability of qualified human resources. A number of conclusions and suggestions are offered so that future watershed modification proposals may be planned and implemented in a more environmentally sustainable fashion. These include: (1) EIA processes must be completed before irrevocable decisions are made. (2) Any major intrusion into a watershed is likely to impact on some major components of the ecosystem(s). (3) Mitigation costs must form part of the benefit-cost analysis of any project proposal. (4) Interjurisdictional cooperation is imperative where watersheds cross political boundaries. (5) The EIA process is a public process, hence public concerns must be dealt with fairly. (6) The role of science in the EIA process must be at arms length from project proponents and regulators, and allowed to function in the interest of the protection of the environment and public health and safety. © 1993 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.", Assessment process; Environmental impact; Impoundment; River diversion; Watershed modification,1.0

719,Challenges at the early stages of the environmental licensing procedure and potential contributions from geomorphology,"Defining impact significance is the main technical task that influences decision-making during the Environmental Licensing Procedure (ELP). The ELP begins with screening to determine potentially significant impacts of the proposed project. Scoping then follows to address any interventions deemed worthy of attention in the production of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). This will include consideration of relevant landforms and geomorphological processes. However, preliminary assessments of environmental impacts often lack the scientific robustness to procure substantive and transactive effectiveness. This review presents an examination of the established practices of screening and scoping while highlighting the foremost challenges to improve the technical grounds of the ELP. The analysis of screening and scoping practices stresses the need for novel methods that ensure the sequential reasoning between their criteria while improving the preliminary evaluation of impact significance. Reducing the inherent subjectivity of discretionary judgment requires scientific methodologies that acknowledge the interaction between the natural system and human interventions, which has been addressed by geomorphological research. The knowledge consolidated in this review opens the gate to explore the compatibility between the United Nations strategy of Ecosystem Approach (EA) with the ELP through a novel geomorphological interpretation of the EIA. Therefore, this diagnosis demonstrate that screening and scoping practices would benefit from reliable methods that balance the precautionary principle with the efficient character required in the ELP. © 2021 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University", Ecosystem approach; EIA effectiveness; Geomorphological processes; Landforms; Screening and scoping practices,1.0

Five case studies where SIA was employed in conjunction with Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) for agricultural development projects are evaluated. In addition, the performance of the policy context is assessed. This research revealed that there are legal and institutional constraints to the effective functioning of SIA in Iran, and that there are deficiencies in the operating guidelines. There were serious problems associated with the way SIA was undertaken in all five case studies. Recommendations to improve the policy framework for the conduct of SIA are made. The recommendations advocate for a higher profile of SIA within legislation, for social issues to have greater emphasis in official guidelines for the conduct of EIA and SIA, and for a range of measures to increase the professionalism of SIA practice. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

721,Stakeholder participation within the public environmental system in Chile: Major gaps between theory and practice,"The main objective of this paper is to present a critical analysis of the stakeholder participation process within the Environmental Impact Assessment System in Chile, after ca. 14 years of being enforced. This analysis is sustained by the description and analysis of the stakeholder participation possibilities in a representative rural area of North-Central Chile. The Environmental Basis Act 19300, enacted in 1994, considers the participation of the local community in the environmental impact assessment of new projects. However, this possibility is very limited and difficult to exert, often resulting in frustration for the participants. This is due to a number of reasons, such as the imbalance of resources and knowledge among the majority of participating communities and project proponents, the complexity and administrative and legal constraints to participation, and the dominant interest of the Central Government in approving investments, specifically in energy and natural resources related projects, which generate wealth and jobs. Also, the State's rush to develop Internet-based communication and management systems has built a barrier for poor, traditional communities. This factor is clearly reflected in the case study considered. Results show that there is generally a significant lack of knowledge about institutions and participation tools. From this base, we intend to raise concern on these selected aspects that could be addressed to improve the effectiveness of the existing framework, both in Chile and in other developing countries, where immature environmental impact assessment and public management systems face similar pressures in relation to the sustainable use of their natural resources. Finally, some basic steps are proposed in order to make the community participation an effective tool for sustainable development. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.", 19300 Law; Elqui basin; Impact assessment; Public involvement; Sustainable development,1.0
722,Product Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a Tool for Environmental Management,"Life Cycle Assessment, included in company environmental management methods, has particular importance in marketing management. Analysis of dangers to the environment through tools such as the LCA method allows for comparisons of alternative company management strategies. LCA is characterised as a technique for environmental management that enables environmental impact assessment of the product, process, industry, and even the comprehensive economic sector. LCA also influences decisions regarding environmental policy modification, but most importantly, it influences a company's marketing activities. The LCA technique is applied the world over with great effectiveness in studying specific phases of a product's life cycles – from 'birth to death'; however, Poland's experience in this domain constitutes continuously developing research areas. The experience of foreign research centres confirms the possibility of applying LCA techniques in supporting environmental risk assessment of innovative technologies where LCA is used to study the environmental impact of a new generation product, i.e. flocculants from polymer wastes. This article presents the results of a study of the effectiveness of applying a new generation of polyelectrolyte (gained from polystyrene waste) in treating industrial wastewater and the LCA environmental impact assessment, which was carried out using SimaPro software. Based on the analysis of the results of the application of sodium salts of sulfone derivatives of polystyrene in the treatment of mine water, it was found that these products significantly reduced the pollution indicators of mine water from KWK1. Accordingly, they provided the basis for the development of technical-scale technology. © 2023. Author(s).", company marketing; environmental management; product life cycle assessment,0.0
723,Environmental impact assessment of flood mitigation measures: Methodology based on risk analysis,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a process with several important purposes, the principal of which is to be an aid to decision-making; providing decision-makers with a focused evaluation of the likely environmental consequences of sanctioning a proposed development action, before a decision is taken and at a time where it can actually affect the outcome. Risk analysis (RA) has become in recent years an important tool for decision-making and management activities. The objective of the paper is to propose a methodology for assessing water constructions, which will allow the assessment impact of water constructions on the environment and hence select the best option for the permission process. This methodology is intended to streamline the process of EIA of constructions in the field of water management. One of the paper's objectives is to create a system of EIA of water constructions through RA evaluation of options, the result of which should lead to the selection of future activity, quantified with minimum risk to the environment. Comparison options and the designation of the optimal variant will be implemented based on selected criteria which objectively describe the characteristic lines of the planned variants and their impact on the environment. The application of developed methodology for the process of EIA will develop assumptions for further improvements and, respectively, more effective implementation and performance of this process. © 2014 WIT Press.", Environmental impact assessment; Flood protection measures; Risk analysis,1.0
724,Public participation in environmental impact assessment - Implementing the Aarhus Convention,"This article explores the nature of public participation in the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process in the context of the potential integration of the Aarhus Convention principles into the UK EIA system. Although the Convention advocates 'early' and 'effective' participation, these terms remain undefined and questions persist about exactly how to implement the Aarhus principles. Ten practice evaluation criteria derived from the Aarhus Convention are used to analyse the public participation procedures used in four UK waste disposal EIA case studies. The paper reports the extent to which the practice evaluation criteria were fulfilled, explores the types and effectiveness of the participation methods used in the EIAs, and highlights some of the key barriers that appear to impede the execution of 'early' and 'effective' participation programmes. It concludes that the Aarhus Convention will undoubtedly lead to a strengthening of participation procedures but that the level of improvement secured will depend upon how its ideals are interpreted and incorporated into legislation and practice. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

725,"Assessing ammonia emission abatement measures in agriculture: Farmers' costs and society's benefits – A case study for Lower Saxony, Germany","Ammonia (NH3) emissions have adverse impacts on the environment and, being a precursor for fine particulate matter, also on human health. About 95% of NH3 emissions in Germany originate from agriculture, mainly from livestock husbandry. This case study is aimed at presenting an approach that evaluates NH3 emission abatement measures in agriculture regarding their abatement costs for farmers and their benefits for the society in terms of avoided external costs of health damages and loss of terrestrial biodiversity. Following the impact-pathway chain, an economic-ecological farm model for estimating NH3 emission reductions and abatement costs was combined with an environmental impact assessment model for estimating the benefits for human health and biodiversity. The case study analysed a variety of manure storage cover and application techniques in Lower Saxony, a region in the north-west of Germany with the highest livestock density in Germany and high NH3 emissions. In the reference situation, the damage costs of NH3 emissions were EUR 2.7 billion. The implementation of concrete storage covers and slurry injection, the most effective measures, reduced NH3 emissions by 25% and achieved net benefits of EUR 505 million. Farmers' abatement costs averaged over all farms ranged from EUR 3.6 to 6.8 per kilogramme NH3 reduced. The abatement costs per farm type ranged from EUR 2.4 to 16.6 for floating plastic covers and from EUR 2.2 to 11.4 for concrete covers. The abatement costs for floating plastic covers were lower for grazing livestock specialists, while the abatement costs for concrete covers were lower for pig specialists, poultry specialists and mixed farms. Farm type specific abatement costs for manure application techniques ranged from EUR 4.5 to 9.6 per kilogramme NH3 reduced with little variation between trailing shoe and cultivator/injector techniques. Abatement costs for trailing shoe application were lower than for cultivator/injector application for grazing livestock specialists, poultry specialists and mixed farms. The average benefits per kilogramme NH3 reduced were EUR 14.1 for health and EUR 10.4 for biodiversity, totalling EUR 24.5. As the benefits exceed the abatement costs for all measures analysed in this study, principally, they can be recommended for implementation. However, the variation in abatement potentials and costs per farm type indicate differences in suitability. While manure covers should above all be implemented by pig specialists because of their high abatement potential, manure application techniques should be implemented by grazing livestock specialists. Among manure storage covers, floating plastic covers are more favourable for grazing livestock specialists, whereas concrete covers are more suitable for all other farm types. The analysis with the farm model was considered more appropriate than recent analyses at technical or macroeconomic level, because the abatement costs reflect differences in farm types, detailed production processes and farmers' profit-maximising behaviour. Overall, it can be concluded that an assessment of NH3 emission abatement measures should be carried out for farm types and should consider impacts of NH3 emission abatement both on human health and biodiversity. The presented modelling approach enables to estimate abatement costs for farm types and benefits for human health and biodiversity. Cost-efficient NH3 emission abatement measures tailored to farm types can be identified and farm type specific regional abatement strategies can be developed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd", Agricultural modelling; Air pollution control; Biodiversity loss; Economic-ecological modelling; Environmental impact assessment; Health damage,0.0
726,Ontology for flood management: A proposal,"Floods are very complex phenomena involving a large number of players. In this context not only the hydrologic and hydraulic studies are required, but also those related to vulnerability assessment, town and emergency planning as well as all the matters related to the economic issues: damage, insurance and the psychological diseases which can arise after flood events. Thus, people with widely different roles, backgrounds, and profiles are in charge of each phase of a large number of complex procedures. Not surprisingly, communication problems often arise because different names may be used to refer to the same concepts. Moreover, relevant information can vary, depending on the user. Effective communication is essential since the results produced by a person in a certain phase of the process can be the input that another person needs in the next phase, i.e. raw data versus elaborated data, forecasting versus impact evaluation, level of detail, hazard assessment, vulnerability assessment, economic evaluation, environmental assessment, etc. Ontologies, which can be defined as an explicit representation of a conceptualization, are tools that can be used to solve such very complex and interdisciplinary problems because they specify a conceptual framework or terminology. The paper introduces an ontology for floods. This ontology is developed using the existing Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) ontology and it is represented with OWL-DL (Web Ontology Language - Description Logics). Among the different causes for flood, only those related to river overflows are taken into account in the ontology so far. It is shown as ontologies are useful because they represent the most meaningful knowledge associated with a problem. Moreover, they are also useful because they permit reasoning and inference processes. Inference mechanisms make recommendation procedures possible. © 2012 WIT Press.", Brief ontology; Floods; Hazards; Knowledge representation,0.0
727,Follow-up to environmental impact assessment: Learning from the Canadian Government experience,"The environmental impact assessment procedure for Canadian federal government projects is briefly described. In the non-legislated Canadian system, follow-up to assessments is one of the major means of encouraging and improving the implementation of environmental impact assessment and the quality of environmental work done around development projects. The results of a study on the status of follow-up in the Canadian Government are presented. Factors that limit and that are conducive to follow-up are discussed. The effectiveness of follow-up depends as much on the circumstances surrounding a project and the concerned parties as on the follow-up techniques used; both of these aspects can be addressed in the planning and management of follow-up and of environmental impact assessment overall. Areas for improving the management of follow-up are identified and discussed: planning of follow-up activities, coordination of concerned parties, generation of clear understandings, information management, resource allocation, and maintenance of credibility.

728,A TODIM-based approach for environmental impact assessment of pumped hydro energy storage plant,"Making environmental impact assessment (EIA) is extremely vital to the green development of pumped hydro energy storage plants (PHESPs). But, three critical issues have not been addressed. First, some key environmental factors having big influences on PHESP have not been identified and evaluated. Second, massive of information loss and distortion exist in current research. Third, there is a lack of a systematic and clear framework for EIA of PHESP. To handle the above three problems and make EIA of PHESP more reasonable, innovations are made from the following aspects: first, to fully reflect environmental characteristics of PHESP, a comprehensive and rational EIA evaluation criteria system including four criteria is built. Second, a group decision-making model is proposed by combining uncertain linguistic variables (ULVs), triangular fuzzy number (TFN) and TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multiple attribute decision making), this model can effectively reduce information loss and distortion. Third, an integrated decision-making framework is constructed from the perspective of system science, this framework can make EIA easy and efficient. Besides, a case study is employed to validate the practicability and effectiveness of the improvements made above. The results show that the proposed framework is of great use for performing EIA of PHESP, and PHESPA1 performs best among the four alternatives in the environmental aspect. Meanwhile, sensitivity analysis shows that the ranking of four alternatives is very stable; comparative analysis proves that the proposed model is more effective than fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method in reflecting gaps among four alternatives, because its standard deviation 0.360 is bigger than the standard deviation 0.153 gotten by the fuzzy TOPSIS method. Finally, some valuable managerial implications are put forward to the project managers to guide the practical work. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd", Environmental impact assessment; Pumped hydro energy storage plant; TODIM; Triangular fuzzy number,1.0
729,Environmental Impact Assessment Effectiveness in Public-Private Partnerships: Study on the Colombian Toll Road Program,"Public-private partnership (PPP) has been positioned as a relevant contracting method for developing large-scale infrastructure projects that entails potentially high-magnitude negative impacts on the environment. The effectiveness of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) is crucial to achieving sustainable development of these large-scale infrastructure projects. To unravel the drivers for the EIA effectiveness and the multiple combinations built by the complexity of these drivers, this paper analyzes 28 road PPP projects from Colombia employing a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) approach. This paper decodes conjectural causal links between specific conditions grouped in superordinate clusters (i.e., consultants' capability, project features, and communities' participation) and EIA effectiveness dimensions (i.e., normative, procedural, substantive, and transactive). Findings revealed that no single combination of causal conditions ensures multidimensional EIA effectiveness. This study demonstrated that EIA effectiveness relies significantly on the integration of specific features of three external stakeholders: consultants, nonpreferred proponents, and communities. This study constitutes the first empirical multidimensional identification of the combination of conditions that generate EIA effectiveness in road PPPs. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.", Community involvement; Concessionaire; Consultants' capability; Environmental impact assessment (EIA); Prior consultation; Public-private partnership (PPP); Qualitative comparative analysis,1.0
730,"Open-source methods for estimating health risks of fine particulate matter from coal-fired power plants: A demonstration from Karachi, Pakistan","Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) effectiveness and accessibility by the public is determined by local environmental enforcement and regulation. Massive energy infrastructure projects like China's Belt and Road initiative (BRI) could accentuate social and economic costs, as regulation is deferred to host countries with varying levels of domestic enforcement. To fill major gaps in the public evaluation of EIA practices and results, our objective here is to present an open-source approach for evaluating localized air pollution health impacts for BRI-financed coal-fired power plants. This analysis focuses on one specific problem, additional attributable mortality from stroke, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for adults ages 25–84 from fine particulate matter (PM2.5), known to be major risk factor for premature deaths globally. As a concrete example, we examine the case of the Port Qasim power plant located near Karachi, Sindh Province, Pakistan. We present results for two main scenarios: a base case, assuming fully operational pollution control technologies, in particular electrostatic precipitators (ESP); and an alternative case without ESPs. All material and methods for replicating this analysis for the case study and for other projects are available in our institutional open repository. Our approach can be applied immediately to virtually any source location in the world, due to the public and global availability of input data.

731,The role of environmental assessment (EA) in Iranian water management,"In this paper, we reflect on the effectiveness of environmental assessment (EA for e.g. projects, policies, plans and programmes) in Iranian water management. Urmia Lake Basin (ULB) is used as a case study area and the extent to which EA appears to be delivering environmental protection objectives is established. Data were collected using document analyses, semi-structured interviews with local experts and site visits. It is established that activities are restricted to project level EIA (environmental impact assessment) and that EA is not able to address and mitigate the negative effects of extensive water exploitation through dam- and well building. Strengthening EIA legislation as well as introducing SEA is suggested as a possible way to address shortcomings, in particular with regard to addressing cumulative and wider basin effects. © 2018, © 2018 IAIA.", EA effectiveness; Iran; Urmia Lake; water,1.0
732,Health impact assessment practice and potential for integration within environmental impact and strategic environmental assessments in Italy,"Avoiding or minimizing potential environmental impact is the driving idea behind protecting a population’s health via Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs). However, both are often carried out without any systematic approach. This paper describes the findings of a review of HIA, EIA and SEA experiences carried out by the authors, who act as institutional competent subjects at the national and regional levels in Italy. The analysis of how health is tackled in EIA and SEA procedures could support the definition of a protocol for the integration of HIA with EIA and SEA. Although EIA and SEA approaches include the aim of protecting health, significant technical and methodological gaps are present when assessing health systematically, and their basic principles regarding assessment are unsatisfactory for promoting and addressing healthcare concepts stated by the WHO. HIA is still poorly integrated into the decision-making process, screening and monitoring phases are only occasionally implemented, and operational details are not well-defined. The collaborative approach of institutions involved in environment and health is a core element in a systematic advancement toward supporting effective decisions and effective protection of the environment and health. At the Italian national level, the definition of guidelines and tools for HIA, also in relation with EIA and SEA, is of great interest. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.", Environmental impact assessment; Health impact assessment; Impact assessment tools; Policy decision-making; Public health policy; Strategic impact assessment,1.0
733,An evaluation of air quality impact prediction performance undertaken as part of environmental impact assessment (EIA) in India,"Effective implementation of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is recognised as a global issue, in particular the impact prediction stage, which is the ‘core’ of EIA. Consisting of four stages: impact identification, impact assessment, significance evaluation, and mitigation measures on the possible environmental repercussions of project developmental activities, the efficacy of impact prediction can define the quality of the EIA process, which will better align environmental decision-making to sustainable development. The weakness of impact prediction in EIA demands more study to enhance practice. Although this is widely explored in the context of developed countries such as the UK, it is particularly concerning in India. A specialised review package built from several sources is utilised to assess the efficacy of air quality impact prediction, based on Lee & Colley (1991). 20 EIA reports of Category A (mega-scale projects causing significant environmental impacts) are reviewed. This study's evaluation indicates that significance evaluation and mitigation actions are the weakest phases and a major concern while assessing air quality studies conducted as a part of EIA. Recommendations to improve the process include prioritising the cumulative impact assessment within the regulatory framework, enhancing capacity building, embedding public participation and instilling accountability among stakeholders, which can be adopted globally. Additional recommendations specifically for India are revising the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), restructuring the EIA review mechanism by EAC and improving mitigation measures by adopting GIS and remote sensing technologies. © 2024 The Authors", Air quality; Environmental impact assessment; Impact assessment; Impact prediction; India; Megaprojects,1.0

To determine this requires an examination of environmental outcomes for projects that have undergone EIA. Four case studies from Western Australia are described. During project appraisal, strong emphasis was placed on the need for ongoing monitoring and management programmes. The implementation of these programmes was found to be central to successful achievement of project and environmental performance objectives. The case studies demonstrate that a strong relationship exists between EIA and ongoing environmental management in Western Australia.", ,1.0

In a case study on the construction of a large chemical plant in The Netherlands, it was found that the associated decision-making is unstructured, uncontrollable, and unpredictable. Furthermore, the actual contents of the EIA contributed little to decision-making on the environmental permits. To alleviate the problems identified and to improve the quality of the EIA decision-making, we used the 'process approach' to formulate a novel framework for environmental decision-making. The main differences between the proposed approach and the present Dutch situation are that all of the knowledge and opinions of all parties become available at the start of decision-making and that time pressure is largely avoided.

The advancement of digital technologies has enabled societal involvement in decision-making processes, however, its reach and effectiveness, especially in terms of influence on decision-making, remain underexplored. This study analyzed social participation in the hybrid-format public hearing of the Serra do Taquaril Mining Complex (CMST) Project, proposed to be installed in Serra do Curral, an area of significant cultural, social, and environmental relevance to the region of Belo Horizonte/MG. The qualitative research employed document analysis of the Public Hearing Activity Report to investigate: the timing and locations of the hearings; transportation provision; technological resources and digital inclusion; language and presentation of the project and its impacts; the attendance list, and the participation of community leaders and civil society members. The findings revealed, among other aspects, low participation at in-person locations but an increase in digital access from both target and external municipalities. Technical issues, such as internet connection problems and participants' lack of familiarity with the videoconferencing platform, limited the opportunities for participants to speak. Reflections were also made on participation in hybrid-format hearings and the case as a whole.

737,An overview of biodiversity and conservation status of steppes of the Anatolian Biogeographical Region,"The Anatolian Biogeographical Region is unique in the Palearctic realm, with high plant and butterfly species richness and populations of globally threatened birds, mammals and herptiles (amphibians and reptiles). It is a place of diverse land-use practices, dating back to the earliest farming practices in the world. Among 10,930 species of vascular plants, birds, butterflies, mammals and herptiles distributed in Turkey, we identified 1130 living predominantly in steppic environments and being classified either as threatened, near-threatened or data deficient at the national level, if not globally. A total of 28 effective protected areas were present in the region, covering 1.5 % of the 391,597 km2 land area. Only 16.2 % of the threatened and near-threatened species (n = 809) were distributed within the protected area network, ranging from 94.1 % for birds to as low as 12.9 % for vascular plants. The total area of steppe and steppe forest vegetation has been reduced by at least 44 % of its former extent due to diverse habitat destructive activities. The most significant threats arise from unsustainable agricultural activities including overgrazing, conversion to croplands and afforestation. To maintain steppe diversity, we propose a “to-do list”, including mainstreaming biodiversity, effective implementation of Turkey’s Rangeland Act, conducting effective environmental impact assessments, establishing an effective site network for steppe biodiversity conservation and filling gaps in scientific knowledge. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.", Dry grassland; Land use; Protected area; Threat; Turkey; Vascular plants,1.0

739,Application of Leather Waste Fractions and Their Biochars as Organic Fertilisers for Ryegrass Growth: Agri-Environmental Aspects and Plants Response Modelling,"The automotive upholstery industry, which processes bovine leathers, has struggled with vast amounts of solid waste, of which the majority are fractions, such as shavings and splits and offcuts, both containing chromium (Cr) and free of Cr. In this work, a novel leather waste-to-fertiliser approach has been tested: four lightly processed (incubation with effective microorganisms) and three aggressively processed (using pyrolysis or hydrolysis processes) tanned leather waste fractions were used. They were applied as organic nitrogen-based fertilisers in two separate glasshouse experiments, consisting of four subsequent harvests, under spring–autumn conditions in northern Poland. The Cr stressing effect caused by bovine shavings containing Cr and splits and offcuts containing Cr stimulated an increase in ryegrass growth after 30 days, providing twice the dry matter yield than bovine shavings free of Cr and splits and offcuts free of Cr, then (after 90 and 120 days) it inhibited growth. The Monod kinetics model was developed using the best fitting procedure (R2 > 0.94) for the efficiency of internal N use in ryegrass for the lightly processed fractions of tanned leather-waste fractions and each harvest. In the case of the processed leather waste-fractions, the relation was quasi linear, evidencing less growth inhibition and no over-fertilisation effects. The acid hydrolysate of bovine shavings containing Cr showed the best performance, reaching a relative agronomic effectiveness (RAE, N utilization-based) equal to 89%, 95%, 19%, and 38% for 30, 60, 90, and 120 days, respectively, and 71% in total. For the lightly processed fractions, it was lower than 12%.

740,"Improvement of environmental impact assessment using dempster-shafer theory (case study: Binalud county, Khorasan Razavi)","Introduction: Environmental impact assessment is a systematic process to identify, predict and evaluate the environmental effects of proposed actions and projects. This process is applied prior to major decisions and commitments being made. Environment, social, cultural and health effects are considered as an integral part of EIA. Particular attention is paid to EIA practice for preventing, mitigating, and offsetting the significant adverse effects of proposed actions. Uncertainty is present when the knowledge about future conditions is incomplete or lacking and also the possibility to make precise decisions about these conditions is low. Using the theory of Dempster-Shafer is a novel methodology for decision-making under uncertain conditions in environmental assessment as we try to examine with insufficient, fuzzy and uncertain data. This theory provides a mathematical framework for describing incomplete and inadequate data. Materials and Methods: The Dempster-Shafer theory has an advantage over the Bayesian probability theory. In Bayesian probability theory, only singleton hypotheses are recognized and assumed to be exhaustive. Thus, ignorance is not recognized, and lack of evidence for a hypothesis constitutes evidence against that hypothesis. These requirements and assumptions are often not warranted in real-world decision situations. In contrast to this, the logic of Dempster-Shafer theory can express the degree to which the state of one's knowledge does not distinguish between the hypotheses. This is known as ignorance. Ignorance expresses the incompleteness of one's knowledge as a measure of the degree to which we cannot distinguish between any of the hypotheses. The basic assumptions of Dempster-Shafer theory are that ignorance exists in the body of knowledge, and that belief for a hypothesis is not necessarily the complement of the belief for its negation. A belief function can be viewed as a generalized probability function and the belief and plausibility measures can be regarded as lower and upper bounds for the probability of an event. To express the concept in mathematical terms, let θ = {H1, H2,⋯, HN} be a collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive set of hypotheses or propositions, which is called the frame of discernment. A basic probability assignment (bpa) is a function m: 2θ [0, 1], which is called a mass function, satisfying: (Equation Presented) where, Φ is an empty set, A is any subset of θ, and 2θ is the power set of θ, which consists of all the subsets of θ, i.e. (Equation Presented) The assigned probability (also called probability mass) m(A) measures the belief exactly assigned to A and represents how strongly the evidence supports A. All the assigned probabilities sum to unity and there is no belief in the empty set (Φ). The assigned probability to θ, i.e. m(θ), is called the degree of ignorance. Each subset A⊆ θ such that m(A)> 0 is called a focal element of m. All the related focal elements are collectively called the body of evidence. Associated with each bpa is the belief measure, Bel, and the plausibility measure, PI, which are both functions: 2θ [0, 1], and given by Bel(A) = ΣB⊆AM(B) and P1(A) = ΣA∩B≈tøm(B), Where A and B are subsets of θ. Bel(A) represents the exact support to A, i.e. the belief of the hypothesis A being true; P1(A) represents the possible support to A, i.e. the total amount of belief that could be potentially placed in A. [Bel(A), P1(A)] constitutes the interval of support to A and can be seen as the lower and upper bounds of the probability to which A is supported. The two functions are related to each other by PI (A) = 1- Bel(Ã), where Ã denotes the complement of A. The difference between the belief and the plausibility of a set A describes the ignorance of the assessment for the set A. Belief represents the total support for an hypothesis, and will be drawn from the BPAs for all subsets ofthat hypothesis, i.e.,: BEL(X) = Σm(Y) when Y⊆X In contrast to belief, plausibility represents the degree to which a hypothesis cannot be disbelieved. Unlike the case in Bayesian probability theory, disbelief is not automatically the complement of belief, but rather, represents the degree of support for all hypotheses that do not intersect with that hypothesis. Thus: PL(X) = 1 - BEL(X) where X = not X Thus, PL(X) = Σm(Y) when Y∪X ≈ φ Interpreting these constructs, we can say that while belief represents the degree of hard evidence in support of a hypothesis, plausibility indicates the degree to which the conditions appear to be right for that hypothesis, even though hard evidence is lacking. For each hypothesis, then, belief is the lower boundary of our commitment to that hypothesis, and plausibility represents the upper boundary. The range between the two is called the belief interval, and represents the degree of uncertainty in establishing the presence or absence ofthat hypothesis. As a result, areas with a high belief interval are those in which new evidence will supply the greatest degree of information. Dempster-Shafer is thus very useful in establishing the value of information and in designing a data gathering strategy that is most effective in reducing uncertainty. The Belief module can be used to implement the Dempster-Shafer logic. The Belief module has a wide variety of applications, as it can aggregate many different sources of information to predict the probability that any phenomenon might occur. Therefore, all assessment information, quantitative or qualitative, complete or incomplete, and precise or imprecise, can be modeled using a unified framework of a belief structure. Therefore, Dempster-Shafer Weight-of-Evidence modeling has been chosen as efficient method for the aggregation of data in tourism impact assessment. The tourism impact assessment by using Dempster-Shafer theory comprises multiple steps, in this research. In the first step, we identify the criteria for tourism impact assessment. Complex decision-making problems are usually modeled in terms of a number of decisive variables that are related hierarchically. Pieces of evidence are aggregated in a bottom-up way to determine the final decision goal. In the second step, we collect data from multiple information sources like human experts, questionnaire, models, etc. on the selected criteria for evaluation purposes. In the third step, the information from multiple data sources is combined using Dempster-Shafer theory and the impact assessment of Binalud region for tourism is estimated. Performing risk analysis can be a challenging task for complex systems due to the lack of data and insufficient understanding of the failure mechanisms. Thus, in this study the D-S Theory is used because of its ability to deal with ignorance and missing information which is very likely in realistic tourism development impact assessment and also its ability to deal with multiple decision makers and heterogeneous data types. Basically, the Dempster-Shafer theory is well-known for its usefulness to express uncertain judgments of experts. On the other hand, our evaluation about the information and land resources is basically based on the expert judgments. Results and Discussion: Data and maps of important factors for tourism development in the present study were gathered and converted to raster format. Then, the fuzzy raster maps were treated for their ecological suitability or lack of suitability for recreation in the impact assessment of the suggested tourism and ecotourism for the area of study. In the next step, each map was introduced to the belief procedure. After entering all information, the process divided all the evidence based on the underlying hypotheses (appropriate, inappropriate, appropriate-inappropriate) and combined them to produce three images of belief, plausibility and belief interval. The image of the region recreational impact assessment using the fuzzy and multi-criteria evaluation method was also prepared and compared with the belief image. Conclusions: The results showed that the belief procedure has produced a more reliable result for the tourism development and its impact assessment. The implementation of the theory in a region can present better results.

741,Environmental impact assessment of limestone quarry using multispectral satellite imagery,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a prominent technology to assess the environmental changes in the open cast Limestone mining region. However, traditional EIA methods and Limestone deposit identification involves time consuming, cost effective and manpower requirements. We cope-up these problem and incorporated with different satellite image processing techniques and field studies to estimate the impact on environment. Landsat imageries have been used to calculate NDVI, NDWI, LULC, LST for the buffer zone within a 10 km radius of the mines from the period between 1997–2017. The noise pollution of the mining region is identified using a random sample method. To access water quality analysis in the area, the Water Quality Index (WQI) is generated using 12 water quality parameters. EIA is analyzed using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and future EIA is also predicted using empirical Bayesian Kriging approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.", AHP; EIA; Landsat ETM +; Landsat OLI; Limestone; LST; LULC; MCDA; NDVI; NDWI; WQI,1.0
742,Enhancing energy intelligence in Taiwanese office buildings: Utilizing a novel BIM-derived dataset for AI-driven energy consumption prediction,"This research addresses the significant greenhouse gas emissions from the construction sector by focusing on the power consumption of office buildings in Taiwan. It introduces an innovative framework combining Building Information Modeling (BIM) and machine learning (ML) to enhance energy intelligence. A primary objective of this study is the development of the TaiBIM_EnergyOffice dataset using BIM. This dataset, a comprehensive repository of energy consumption patterns specific to typical Taiwanese office buildings, addresses key variables such as architectural configurations, material specifications, and environmental conditions to ensure the factors influencing energy consumption are holistically represented. Using the TaiBIM_EnergyOffice data, ML-driven predictions of annual electricity consumption were generated. Among the models tested, the hybrid FBI_BA models outperformed others, achieving an R2 value of 0.944 and a mean absolute percentage error of 3.45%. These results validate the framework's effectiveness in providing actionable insights for operational cost evaluation and environmental impact assessment. This study addresses critical gaps in the availability of region-specific datasets and advances the integration of BIM with ML for energy prediction. This integration overcomes the computational limitations of simulation tools and provides rapid, scalable, and insightful energy consumption predictions. By bridging static BIM data with dynamic energy modeling, the framework enhances energy intelligence while supporting the broader goal of reducing environmental impact through energy-efficient building practices in Taiwan. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.", Annual electric; BIM; Energy consumption; Energy dataset; Energy management; Hybrid model; Machine learning; Sustainable construction; Taiwan office buildings,0.0
743,Managing marine environments and decision-making requires better application of the physical sedimentary sciences,"Effective management of marine environments requires a sound understanding of the relevant physical sedimentary sciences. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a key management and decision-making tool employed in Australia for coastal and marine developments. This article examines the veracity of the application of the marine physical sciences within the EIA process, using turbidity measurement and sediment transport pathways as examples. A review of EIA guidance reveals deficiencies in regulation. Turbidity measurement is poorly understood and performed in current practice, while a focus on protecting marine habitats largely ignores those physical sedimentary processes, such as long-term bed-sediment transport pathways, that create and maintain these habitats. Thus evaluations of impacts of offshore activities such as channel dredging and spoil emplacement at sea are fundamentally flawed. An extensive body of scientific knowledge is already available on marine physical processes, and equivalent information for assessments of terrestrial development is routinely taken into consideration. Perhaps practice for the marine environment lags behind that for terrestrial settings or is it a case of ‘out of sight–out of mind’? We call on environmental management professionals to increase engagement with the physical processes that determine the quality of marine environments. © 2017 Environment Institute of Australia and New Zealand Inc.", Australia; impact assessment; Marine environment; physical science; regulation; sediments,1.0
744,EIA and EMS integration: Not wasting the opportunity,"Environmental tools such as environmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental management systems (EMS) can be applied to ensure that major projects are constructed and operated using an approach that enables effective environmental protection. Previous research has shown that these tools are frequently applied in isolation at different stages of the project life cycle. The extent of EIA/EMS integration amongst nine of the biggest UK waste management companies was investigated through semi-structured interviews with environmental staff and thematic analysis of their responses. The research found that partial integration of EIA and EMS is widespread. Companies recognised a range of potential benefits to more closely integrating their processes such as system efficiencies, data availability and recognition from the regulator. However, significant barriers to further integration were identified in the form of cost, company structure and the size of the organisation. In a context where the regulation of the waste industry is increasingly aligned towards a risk-based approach, there is a new opportunity to use EIA outputs in an enhanced EMS. More generally, companies should seek to maintain continuity of personnel across the project life cycle and structure their environmental functions so that EIA and EMS staff can work more closely. This would help ensure that the greatest benefit is derived from both tools. © 2014 © 2014 IAIA.", EIA; EIA follow-up; EMS; integration; UK; waste,1.0
745,Evaluating the performance and procedural effectiveness of Namibia's Environmental Impact Assessment system,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in Namibia was formally introduced in 2007. However, little EIA related research has been undertaken and the system has not been formally reviewed. This paper evaluates the performance and effectiveness of the EIA system in Namibia. The criteria used for the evaluation were obtained from several sources in the literature and based on legal, administrative, and procedural frameworks. Data were collected through literature review, document analysis, and semi-structured interviews. The study revealed that Namibia has a functional EIA system based on fairly good legislation, institutional arrangements and a well outlined EIA process. Analysis of the legislation and administrative frameworks nevertheless highlighted several weaknesses including a lack of coherence in the legislation and poor implementation. Further weaknesses included a lack of monitoring and enforcement capacity, weak communication and information sharing, inadequate financial and human resources, and inappropriate public consultation approaches. It was found that EIA is slowly being accepted in Namibia and it has a preventative effect on proposed developments. The study recommends an urgent need to complete the ongoing legislative reform to close existing gaps and to improve the performance of the EIA system. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.", Effectiveness; EIA system; Namibia; Performance,1.0
746,Improving the effectiveness of planning EIA (PEIA) in China: Integrating planning and assessment during the preparation of Shenzhen's Master Urban Plan,"The enactment and implementation of the 2003 EIA Law in China institutionalised the role of plan environmental impact assessment (PEIA). While the philosophy, methodology and mechanisms of PEIA have gradually permeated through the various levels of government with a positive effect on the process and outcome of urban planning, only a few cities in China have so far carried out PEIA as a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA)-type procedure. One such case is the southern city of Shenzhen. During the past three decades, Shenzhen has grown from a small town to a large and booming city as China has successfully and rapidly developed its economy by adopting the ""reform and open door"" policy. In response to the challenges arising from the generally divergent processes of rapid urbanisation, economic transformation and environment protection, Shenzhen has incrementally adopted the SEA concept in developing the city's Master Urban Plan. As such, this paper reviews the effectiveness of PEIA in three ways: •as a tool and process for achieving more sustainable and strategic planning;•to determine the level of integration of SEA within the planning system; and,•its effectiveness vis-à-vis implementation.The implementation of PEIA within Shenzhen's Master Urban Plan offers important insights into the emergence of innovative practices in undertaking PEIA as well as theoretical contributions to the field, especially in exploring the relationship between PEIA and SEA and highlighting the central role of local governing institutions in SEA development. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.", China; Environmental governance; Master Urban Plan; Shenzhen; Strategic Environmental Assessment; Sustainable development,1.0
747,Environmental impact assessment of wastewater treatment system by LCA technique,"Social systems and production systems in modern society are closely related over a wide field, and therefore complicated. Various environmental problems exist in the social structure. It is necessary to analyze the effect from various sides for the solution of such problems. Especially, the load to the environment may be made to increase in the integrated network infrastructure, if consideration from the stage of planning and design to environmental harmony is not sufficiently carried out. In this study, the viewpoint of life cycle of facilities until disposal from the design, and environmental effects of disposal, operation and construction in a social foundation utility was determined quantitatively. Considering this background, as one step in solving these environmental problems the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique for environmental impact assessment will be examined in this research. As a result, the LCA technique is shown in application to social utilities represented as a waste water treatment system which is possible and, in addition, a large scale environmental problem to be an object of LCA is possible, that quantitative evaluation can be conducted, and that it is a very effective environmental impact assessment technique.", ,0.0

This article analyzes EIA teaching from the perspective of lecturers who teach EIA in Brazilian Environmental Engineering Programs. Using an online questionnaire for data collection and content analysis as a method for data analysis, the results are based on the perceptions of 37 lecturers. The lecturers participating in the survey are predominantly female, relatively young (mostly between 35 and 45 years old), and almost all of them hold a doctorate. Results indicate that the content taught, and the methods used are aligned with best teaching practices in EIA to varying extents. In addition, lecturers’ perceptions of EIA teaching and practice align with results of scientific research on practitioners perception and EIA effectiveness in Brazil, which point out, for example, lack or limitations in participation, but also the presence of good practices.

749,"Environmental federalism in EIA policy: A comparative case study of Paraná, Brazil and California, US","The literature on environmental impact assessments (EIA) tends to focus on national case studies, while neglecting subnational EIA systems. Federalist countries represent 40 % of the world's population and by their design link national and subnational governments in institutional arrangements that delineate or share power across administrative and sectorial areas. Therefore, the study of institutional arrangements’ influence on the conduct of environmental policy such as EIA is important in evaluating its effectiveness. This research aims to contribute to this area by examining the national and subnational EIA systems in two federalist countries, Paraná, Brazil and California, United States (US). This involved a literature review of the scientific and grey literature as well as legislation and regulations of each case study. This analysis was organized along operational, legislative, administrative, and procedural characteristics building upon existing methods from the EIA literature. The results show each federal country presents different approaches to EIA policy. Brazil represents a more centralized top-down approach based on a licensing system, which offers broader coverage of projects and in theory more standardized implementation. In the case of Paraná, there has been a recent shift towards decentralizing the EIA process for smaller projects to municipalities, although there remain institutional and technical challenges. The US EIA system covers only public projects and therefore is considerably limited in its coverage. California presents the most institutionally and technically competent EIA system of those compared in this study. However, it still suffers from problems of inconsistent implementation and litigation abuse. All case studies are facing increasing political pressures to streamline their processes, often with the proposal of arbitrary timelines. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd", California Environmental Quality Act; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental policy; National Environmental Policy Act,1.0
750,Process and procedure of environmental impact assessment application in some countries of South Asia: A review study,"South Asian Sub-Continent is the most populated region, where one-fifth of world's populations live. People in South Asia are poor, despite of the fact that the region is bestowed with rich natural, cultural and ecological diversity of resources. However, an intensification of industrialization, urbanization with a high rate of population growth has induced many environmental problems in the region. To address the problem of environmental deterioration, South Asian governments have adopted an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), as a project planning tool used for environmental protection and to achieve sustainable development. In principle, environmental consideration was integrated in the national policies during 1980s, however, in practice it was only started in mid 1990s, after the UN Earth Summit of 1992. EIA systems in South Asia have all internationally accepted process steps such as project screening, scoping and development of Terms of Reference (TOR) followed by collection of baseline information on bio-physical, social, economical and cultural components of the environment. Impact prediction is made, evaluating the resources against the proposed project activities. A proposal for mitigating environmental effects is usually developed to implement in project construction and operation. Monitoring plan for investigating the effectiveness of mitigation measures is developed as a part of EIA report. Environmental Management Plan (EMP) highlighting prescription of mitigation measures monitoring schedules, responsibility and cost consideration has been included as a part of EIA report. Public involvement is legally required in all EIA system of South Asia. In procedural aspects, an approval of scoping and TOR may lead to an issuance of a site clearance certificate in some country. An approval of EIA report after review may provide a permit for construction of the proposed project. Upon completion of construction of the project and before the initiation of the project operation, the authorizing agency of the Ministry may issue an environmental clearance certificate. However, this is not true for all the countries as the procedural aspects depend on the provisions given in their respective laws and regulations. EIA report preparation and getting it approved by an authorizing agencies has become a ritual process in South Asia, whereas implementation of EIA is virtually missing in most of the nationally funded project and monitoring part of implementation is very weak in South Asian countries. © 2011 Asian Network for Scientific Information.", Compliance monitoring; Environmental appraisal committee; Environmental clearance certificate; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental management plan; Terms of reference,1.0
751,Material flow analysis: A tool to support environmental policy decision making. Case-studies on the city of Vienna and the Swiss lowlands,"This paper discusses the use of Material Flow Analysis (MFA) as a tool to support policy decision making in the field of resource and environmental management. In terms of policy, MFA can be used for early recognition, priority setting, to analyse and improve the effectiveness of measures and to design efficient material management strategies in view of sustainability. MFA has a high potential to be implemented as a guiding tool at the regional level, for example as part of a regional environmental management and audit system or as a part of the Local Agenda 21 process. Material management based on MFA is complementary to traditional environmental and resource management strategies, which have tended to focus heavily on specific environmental compartments, and measure the concentration of substances in various media. MFA, in contrast, provides an overview of the total system by linking the anthroposphere (that part of the biosphere in which humans' activities take place) with the environment. This system approach shifts the focus away from the back-end so-called 'filter strategies' to more pro-active front-end measures. MFA examines short- and long-term loadings rather than concentrations and highlights current and potential material accumulations, called material stocks. These stocks represent either potential environmental problems (e.g. large stocks of hazardous materials) or a potential source of future resources (e.g. urban mining). In this way, MFA can assist precautionary policy making by highlighting future environmental or resource issue problems without relying on signals of environmental stress. The objective of materials management is: firstly, to analyse material flows and stocks; secondly, to evaluate these results; and thirdly, to control material flows in view of certain goals such as sustainable development. MFA is an excellent tool for the first objective and is well suited to generate a base for the other two objectives. MFA results can be compared against environmental standards or can be interpreted using assessment or indicator methodologies (such as environmental impact assessment or ecological footprints). Selected results from two studies, carried out for the city of Vienna (substance management) and the Swiss lowlands (timber management), illustrate the use of MFA as a tool for early recognition (resource depletion and environmental quality), for priority setting and for effective policy making.", ,0.0
752,Environmental auditing: Artificial waterway developments in Western Australia,"In recent years, environmental auditing has emerged as a means of examining the effectiveness of past environmental impact assessment in an attempt to identify ways of improving the utility and efficiency of future assessments. In this paper, an environmental audit of a range of artificial waterway developments in Western Australia is reported. In particular, three types of audit are reported: a compliance audit in which an assessment is made of whether the conditions established by statutory bodies for mitigating the environmental impacts of the developments have been implemented and enforced; a prediction audit in which the nature and accuracy of impact predictions is evaluated; and an EIA procedures audit to evaluate the effectiveness of the overall EIA process. The results of the audit reported here are encouraging in so far as the level of compliance and prediction accuracy are concerned, although problems with the lack of monitoring data, which have beset earlier audits, prevented follow-up on many impact predictions. © 1992 Academic Press Limited.", artificial waterways; environmental audit; Western Australia,1.0
753,Assessing the environmental impact of industrial pollution using the complex intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTREE method: a case study of pollution control measures,"Environmental pollution has become a major issue in today’s world, and controlling it is crucial for the sustainable development of our planet. Industries play a significant role in environmental pollution, and their impact must be controlled and minimized. In this paper, we present a novel approach, the complex intuitionistic fuzzy ELECTREE method (CIF–ELECTREE), for environmental impact assessment of industries. The method combines the principles of CIF sets and the ELECTREE method to provide a comprehensive and reliable assessment of the environmental impact of industries. The proposed method has been applied to real-world data, and the results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the CIF–ELECTREE method in controlling and reducing the environmental impact of industries. The results show that the CIF–ELECTREE method can provide a more accurate assessment of the environmental impact of industries compared to traditional methods. This study contributes to the existing literature by introducing a novel approach for environmental impact assessment and highlights the importance of considering both the uncertainty and vagueness in real-world data for reliable decision making.

754,Developing a review package to assess the quality of EA reports of local authority structure and local plans in the UK,"Through the process of environmental appraisal (EA) of development plans, strategic environmental assessment (SEA) is establishing itself as a component of good planning practice in the UK. However, this application has been mirrored by concerns about quality. This article describes the process of developing and testing a review package to enable the systematic and structured assessment of the quality of EA reports. The review package was initially developed through analyzing the formal requirements of the draft EU SEA Directive, UK Government guidance, and examples of good international practice. These criteria are reflected in a review package similar in structure to the Lee-Colley project environmental impact assessment (EIA) review package. The article concludes that the developed review package is an effective tool for use when reviewing the quality of EA reports, and can also be used as a checklist when preparing EA reports.

756,Environmental analysis of mining operations: Dynamic tools for impact assessment,"Keeping a high mineral production rate while protecting the environment requires a mining framework where several perspectives are considered and weighed up. The concept of sustainability provides just such a framework. Social and financial needs determine mineral production rates, resulting in a global demand for minerals. To ensure effective environmental protection, different tools and techniques have been developed. One of the most widespread is the so-called Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). This technique is extremely useful but there are also drawbacks. For instance, subjectivity in initial value choices makes model comparison difficult. To overcome some of these problems, this paper sets out a methodology to establish an environmental analysis, focusing on the evolution of environmental impacts over time. This analysis provides a dynamic tool which could be included as part of any EIA-based techniques. The proposed methodology is general enough to apply to different mine project designs since the model includes a typical mining operation layout together with adaptive parameters. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.", Dynamic model; Environmental effects; Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA); Mining,1.0

This paper aims to establish universally-applicable criteria for EIA follow-up to evaluate project performance once assessed and underway. A suite of 24 criteria is derived from EIA follow-up best practice principles published by the International Association for Impact Assessment. The criteria are categorized according to the five dimensions of EIA follow-up: monitoring, evaluation, management, communication and governance. Posed as questions, the criteria support qualitative assessments of EIA follow-up performance for a project. Through application of the criteria to a case study currently under construction (the Shell Cove Marina project in eastern Australia), we found they provided an effective basis for a document review process delivering a short but informative account of the follow-up performance of the case study. The more robust evaluation of some of the criteria, particularly in the governance category, would require supplementary techniques such as interviews. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.", best practice; communication; EIA follow-up; environmental performance; evaluation; governance; management; monitoring,1.0

Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies commenced in the early eighties of the last century with the establishment of the Institute of Environmental Studies in the University of Khartoum. The practice gathered momentum with the recent activities in the oil and roads sectors. Although the practice of (EIA) has only recently been legalized by the passing of the Environment Protection Act of 2001, the performance of EIA is often poor due to flaws in legislative, administrative, institutional and procedural frameworks. Effective implementation of the EIA process in the Sudan requires the institutionalization of the process within the legislative, administrative, political and education system in the country. Special emphasis is needed for the federal system of governance. Other issues include accreditation, sectoral regulations, establishing of a National Centre of EIA for advising the government and for training of human capacities. The paper calls for more involvement of stakeholders via effective popular participation in all steps of EIA.

760,Environmental impact assessment for renewable energy investments through integrated reinforcement learning and molecular fuzzy-based decision-making algorithm,"Environmental impact assessment is a significant component of renewable energy project planning. However, the identification of key environmental performance indicators remains underexplored. In the literature, most existing studies do not adequately prioritize these environmental factors. This situation creates a significant research gap in the renewable energy literature. This study addresses this gap by proposing a novel hybrid decision-making model to identify the most effective investment strategies for improving the environmental performance of renewable energy projects. First, the balanced expert dataset has been constructed by Q-learning algorithm. The second stage is related to the evaluation of the criteria with molecular fuzzy (MF) Bayesian networks (BANEW)-based weighting. Finally, alternatives are ranked by MF multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). This study fills an important gap in the literature on increasing the environmental sustainability of renewable energy investments by integrating molecular geometry-based fuzzy decision-making techniques and Q-learning supported expert weighting method in prioritizing environmental impacts. The use of molecular geometry and fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making analysis together reduces the uncertainty in the solution process of complex problems more effectively. The use of the Q-learning algorithm in the model reduces subjectivity in the decision-making process by providing a dynamic structure based on learning in the weighting of expert opinions. The findings show that biodiversity is the most effective environmental impact of renewable energy investments is mostly on biodiversity. On the other side, it is also identified that the most optimal option for assessing the environmental impact of renewable energy investments is life cycle assessment. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd", Environmental impact; Molecular fuzzy; Q-learning; Renewable energy projects,1.0

Hence, the present study deals with the evaluation of energy, exergy, and environmental parameters of low-cost indirect solar dryer with paraffin wax as energy storage material in rural areas for drying of wheat seeds to check its thermodynamic as well as environmental feasibility. The wheat seeds were dried in solar dryer from initial moisture of 20.2% in 6 h to achieve recommended moisture content which took lesser drying time as compared to open sun drying. The maximum value of collector exergy efficiency, exergy efficiency of drying chamber and pick-up efficiency are 1.5%, 72.62%, and 30.4% respectively. Environmental impacts assessment has revealed that the energy payback, CO2 mitigation, CO2 emission per year and carbon credit earned (at $80 per carbon credit) with present system are 1.35 years, 6.67 tons, 7.32 kg and $533.7, respectively considering the lifetime of solar dryer as 25 years. The performed study shows that the indirect solar dryer with paraffin wax is suitable for the households of rural areas with enhanced performance, lesser waste, sustainable, and lesser adverse effect on environment.

762,The Environmental Impact Assessment of Sanitation Projects in Chile: Overview and Improvement Opportunities Focused on Follow-Ups,"The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a legal and administrative tool aimed to identify, predict, and interpret the impact of a project or activity on the environment and human health. The EIA also evaluates the accuracy of the predictions and audits the effectiveness of the established preventive measures. Regarding the sanitation sector, efficiency of wastewater treatments and sanitation networks determine the pollutant level of the discharged liquid effluents and the subsequent impact on the environment and human health. This problematic makes necessary to assess how proper the regulatory follow-ups of sanitation projects is. This paper evaluates the performance of the Chilean EIA System concerning to sanitation projects. Taking into account that the more restrictive Environmental Impact Study (EIS) and more permissive Environmental Impact Declaration (EID) are the ways for projects’ entry to the EIA System in Chile, 5336 sanitation projects submitted to EIA between 1994 and 2019 were complied. A representative sample of 76 projects (15 entered as EIS and 61 as EID) was analyzed by using a principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) through 14 selected performance indicators. Observed weaknesses have led to propose improvement opportunities of the EIA focused on the follow-ups after the environmental license is obtained, such as creation of a simplified sanctioning procedure, decentralization of decision-making, deadline establishment in each stage, and unified direct link for each project. These proposals seek to improve the effectiveness of monitoring and possible sanctions to early identify impacts of sanitation projects on the environment and human health. This paper introduces a robust methodology for evaluation criteria focused on the follow-ups analysis, which can be used in other countries that consider respectful sanitation projects have direct social and environmental benefits leading to long-term indirect cultural and economic values. © 2022 by the authors.

763,Assessing potential hydrogen cyanide exposure from cyanide-contaminated mine tailing management practices in Thailand's gold mining,"This study assessed the effectiveness of the current cyanide management practice of a large gold mine as a case study of Thailand's cyanide-contaminated mine waste management policy. Most gold mines worldwide use cyanide to extract gold from ore, and various cyanide compounds, including hydrogen cyanide (HCN), are then discharged into a tailing storage facility (TSF). From there, HCN volatizes into the air, and people inhaling HCN can experience chronic, acute, or even fatal effects. Although recently only two gold mines operated in Thailand, many new gold mines are under consideration for future. Unfortunately, no specific government regulations for cyanide-contaminated mine waste management exist besides guidelines from environmental impact assessments prepared by the gold mines themselves. This raises concerns that cyanide volatilization may threaten public health. The current study addresses the need for vital scientific analysis by applying AERMOD modeling to simulate HCN dispersion from the gold mine studied, under 20 scenarios of various pH levels and cyanide concentrations. The results show that the HCN emissions cause acute effects to the public under most scenarios. Chronic effects also occur in scenarios of low pH or high cyanide concentration; however, no simulation showed fatalities. This study determined an acceptable cyanide concentration in TSF that is low enough to theoretically avoid dangerous public exposure. Results show that the mine's recent cyanide discharge limit of 20 mg/l, set by the mine itself, is not safe. To limit dangers from the mine's HCN emissions, cyanide levels in tailings must be carefully calculated and regulated using the HCN dispersion model, being sure to account for pH. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd", AERMOD model; Cyanide management policy; Gold mining; Hydrogen cyanide; Public health,1.0
764,"EIA in Brazil: A procedures-practice gap. A comparative study with reference to the European Union, and especially the UK","Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is now established in many countries of the developed and developing world. EIA systems do, however, vary greatly in procedures and practice. Some countries have clear regulations, others have guidance, others have more ad hoc procedures. Those with well-established procedures may not necessarily be those with the most well-established practice. This can be a particular problem in the less developed countries, and this article explores and seeks to explain the nature of the EIA procedures-practice gap in Brazil. The institutional framework for EIA in Brazil reveals a system that is highly centralised and without the local basis that could improve its effectiveness. The key EIA legislation (CONAMA Resolution 001/86) has many strengths, but also some key weaknesses. There are considerable variations in implementation between the richer and poorer states of the country and there are some examples of good practice (especially in the southern and southeastern states). However, there are problematic links with planning procedures, a lack of secondary regulations, and very few trained and skilled personnel and material resources. There are weaknesses in the EIA process, and the EIS approval procedure is very bureaucratic and easily derailed by political and economic pressures. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the Brazilian EIA system are highlighted through a comparison with EU/UK practice, using a checklist approach. The article concludes with some pointers to the future for the EIA system in Brazil.

It has been generally accepted that instruments such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reduce disaster risks of development projects. This study evaluates the effectiveness of the EIA process in addressing disaster risks in development projects in Sri Lanka and New Zealand, two countries with quite different quality of governance. We find that governance quality does not result in substantive improvements, and neither of the two EIA processes is found to be effective in addressing disaster risk. This is due to inadequate policy integration of disaster risk into the environmental legislation that governs the EIA process. The results suggest that more specificity is needed in legislative provisions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.", Development-induced disasters; Disaster risk; Donor influence; Effectiveness; EIA; Governance,1.0
766,Performance of environmental impact assessment (EIA) screening in South Africa: A comparative analysis between the 1997 and 2006 EIA regimes,"Between September 1997 and March 2006, 43,423 environmental impact assessment (EIA) applications were submitted in South Africa. This exceptionally high number reflects a particular weakness in the ability of the EIA system to effectively screen EIA applications. The 2006 EIA Regulations intended to reduce the number of EIA applications by 20%. This paper presents a comparative analysis of screening performance before and following the 2006 EIA Regulations in order to determine the improvement of screening effectiveness (and hence the EIA process) since the interventions introduced in the 2006 EIA Regulations. Changes in the number of EIA applications as well as the types of activities requiring EIA are analysed. The results show that the average number of EIA applications submitted per month reduced by 27% nationally from 1997 to 2006. Although the 20% reduction target has been achieved, the number of EIA applications remains high compared with international trends and considered against the available administrative capacity. Analysis of the Free State Province also shows that, for both periods, very similar types of activities triggered the majority of EIA applications, with transformation of land, construction of masts and storage of fuel being the most common. To improve EIA screening, it is recommended that the reduction target be reconsidered and that additional screening methods such as environmental management frameworks and norms and standards be implemented. © 2011 Copyright Society of South African Geographers.", environmental impact assessment; performance evaluation; screening,1.0
767,Atmospheric dispersion modeling and radiological environmental impact assessment for normal operation of a proposed pressurized water reactor in the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia,"As a licensing requirement, constructing a new nuclear power plant (NPP) requires performing a radiological environmental impact assessment (REIA) which includes the study of the radioactive releases' effects on the surrounding environment and population. These discharges could be aerial: from chimneys (stacks), evaporation, erosion, re-suspension; or could be liquid discharges: into rivers, lakes, estuaries or coastal waters. This work presents an REIA study for a pressurized water reactor (PWR) assumed to be installed in Umm Huwayd in the Eastern Coast of Saudi Arabia. HYSPLIT tool is utilized to estimate the air concentration and ground deposition of certain released radionuclides such as: 137Cs and 131I. It is also used to analyze the exposure dose's spatial distribution around the nominated site according to direction and distance. The radionuclide dispersion profiles for each of the four weather seasons were examined. The results revealed that the radionuclides dispersion profile is controlled by the weather parameters that varies from season to season. Around the nominated site, Umm Huwayd, the maximum estimated air concentration for 131I radionuclide was 5.6 × 10−6 Bq m−3, and the annual air deposition for 137Cs at the selected site had a peak value of 3.3 × 10−9 Bq m−2. GENII is also utilized to estimate the annual effective dose equivalent and cancer risks around the nominated site. The ingestion pathway contributed to the most of annual effective dose equivalent with 68.35% of the total, while external exposure and inhalation pathways contributed 30.50% and 1.15%, respectively. It is shown that in the nominated site the total annual rate of new cases of cancer (cancer incidence) is 1/109 persons. The cancer death annual rate (cancer fatality) is 5/1010 person. Therefore, the highest risk level around the selected site is much lower than the tolerable levels as suggested by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). © 2022 Elsevier Ltd", Atmospheric dispersion modeling; GENII; HYSPLIT; Pressurized water reactor; Radiological environmental impact assessment; Reactor siting,1.0
768,A cascade approach to continuous rainfall data generation at point locations,"High-resolution temporal rainfall data sequences serve as inputs for a range of applications in planning, design and management of small (especially urban) water resources systems, including continuous flow simulation and evaluation of alternate policies for environmental impact assessment. However, such data are often not available, since their measurements are costly and time-consuming. One alternative to obtain high-resolution data is to try to derive them from available low-resolution information through a disaggregation procedure. This study evaluates a random cascade approach for generation of high-resolution rainfall data at a point location. The approach is based on the concept of scaling in rainfall, or, relating the properties associated with the rainfall process at one temporal scale to a finer-resolution scale. The procedure involves two steps: (1) identification of the presence of scaling behavior in the rainfall process; and (2) generation of synthetic data possessing same/similar scaling properties of the observed rainfall data. The scaling identification is made using a statistical moment scaling function, and the log-Poisson distribution is assumed to generate the synthetic rainfall data. The effectiveness of the approach is tested on the rainfall data observed at the Sydney Observatory Hill, Sydney, Australia. Rainfall data corresponding to four different successively doubled resolutions (daily, 12, 6, and 3 h) are studied, and disaggregation of data is attempted only between these successively doubled resolutions. The results indicate the presence of multi-scaling behavior in the rainfall data. The synthetic data generated using the log-Poisson distribution are found to exhibit scaling behaviors that match very well with that for the observed data. However, the results also indicate that fitting the scaling function alone does not necessarily mean reproducing the broader attributes that characterize the data. This observation clearly points out the extreme caution needed in the application of the existing methods for identification of scaling in rainfall, especially since such methods are also prevalent in studies of the emerging satellite observations and thus in the broader spectrum of hydrologic modeling. © Springer-Verlag 2007.", Data transformation; High-resolution rainfall; Log-Poisson distribution; Moment scaling function; Random cascade; Scale-invariance; Sydney,0.0
769,The importance of context in delivering effective EIA: Case studies from East Africa,"This paper reviews and compares the condition of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) system in three countries in the East Africa region: Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania. The criteria used for the evaluation and the comparison of each system are based on the elements of the legal, administrative and procedural frameworks, as well as the context in which they operate. These criteria are adapted from the evaluation and quality control criteria derived from a number of literature sources. The study reveals that the EIA systems of Kenya and Tanzania are at a similar stage in their development. The two countries, the first to introduce the EIA concept into their jurisdiction in this part of Africa, therefore have more experience than Rwanda in the practice of environmental impact assessment, where the legislation and process requires more time to mature both from the governmental and societal perspective. The analysis of the administrative and procedural frameworks highlights the weakness in the autonomy of the competent authority, in all three countries. Finally a major finding of this study is that the contextual set up i.e. the socio-economic and political situation plays an important role in the performance of an EIA system. The context in developing countries is very different from developed countries where the EIA concept originates. Interpreting EIA conditions in countries like Kenya, Rwanda and Tanzania requires that the analysis for determining the effectiveness of their systems should be undertaken within a relevant framework, taking into account the specific requirements of those countries. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.", Comparative analysis; East Africa region; EIA context; Kenya; Rwanda; Tanzania,1.0
770,Dynamic simulation of life cycle environmental benefits of remanufacturing asynchronous motors to permanent magnet synchronous motors,"Electric motors, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy, are widely utilized as the primary power source for electromechanical equipment. However, the huge energy consumption of electric motors makes their energy efficiency improvements crucial for achieving greenhouse gas reduction goals. As a result, low-efficiency asynchronous motors are being eliminated, while their high-value recycling has subsequently become a key issue. Remanufacturing offers a promising solution to upgrade low-energy efficiency asynchronous motors to high-energy efficiency permanent magnet synchronous motors, but its environmental benefits are unclear. A novel dynamic assessment model that integrates life cycle assessment and lifetime distribution modeling to evaluate the environmental benefits of motor remanufacturing is established. A manufacturing and four remanufacturing scenarios based on the damage profile of individual motor components are developed. The results demonstrate that motor remanufacturing can significantly reduce carbon emissions by 26.75%–65.13%. The model was also applied to various recycling scenarios and synchronous motor market penetration levels to provide a long-term environmental benefit in the motor industry in China by 2040. Findings suggest that the motor remanufacturing industry can achieve peak carbon reduction in 2035 and 2033 under the medium and high market penetration scenarios, respectively. It's also disclosed that remanufacturing offers considerable material savings (36%–73%), energy savings (28%–63%), and water savings (34%–88%). The environmental benefits of motor remanufacturing industry are quantified for the first time, demonstrating its effectiveness in facilitating a green and low-carbon transition. The dynamic assessment methodology system constructed in this research can provide a theoretical framework and research ideas for the environmental impact assessment of other end-of-life product management. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd", Dynamic simulation; Life cycle assessment; Motor efficiency; Remanufacturing; Weibull distribution,0.0
771,Post-assessment in policy-based strategic environmental assessment: Taking China's agricultural support and protection subsidy policy as an example,"As the top-level component of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) system, policy-based strategic environmental assessment (SEA) plays an important role in avoiding the negative environmental impacts of policy implementation. However, the development of policy-based SEA in China is relatively slow due to institutional and technical difficulties. In fact, the effective inclusion of policy-based SEA in the early stage of policy decision-making will continue to face major and long-term practical resistance in the future, such that conducting policy-based SEA on a large-scale will be difficult. Therefore, this study proposes a chain-type post-assessment framework suitable for assessing the environmental impact of policies under implementation from the perspective of policy life cycle assessment to promote policy-based SEA to cover more policies. This framework includes five parts, namely, policy analysis, impact identification, impact analysis, cause exploration, and policy recommendations. This framework follows a typical model with environmental impact analysis as the core and incorporates the concept of system optimization. Following this framework, this study conducts an EIA of China's agricultural support and protection subsidy policy (ASPSP). The study finds that the framework demonstrated good applicability in the post-assessment of policies under implementation. In the future, to promote the establishment and development of policy-based SEA in China, work should be conducted from the following aspects: promotion of the policy EIA into law, establishment of an assessment framework throughout the policy life cycle, and strengthening the research on methods. Through case studies, this study finds that China's ASPSP, which is beneficial to the environment in terms of policy design, lacks a prominent positive impact on the eco-environment and even has a negative impact. This is related not only to unreasonable policy design but also to deviation from policy implementation under the joint action of policy implementers, policy object, and the policy implementation environment. In the future, while continuing to optimize and adjust policies, work should be conducted in terms of optimizing the policy implementation environment, improving policy implementation methods, and strengthening the foundation of policy implementation to improve policy effectiveness. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.", Chain-type assessment framework; China's agricultural support and protection subsidy policy; Policy-based strategic environmental assessment; Post-assessment,1.0
772,"Comprehensive framework for analysis of EIA effectiveness: Evidence from Espírito Santo State, Brazil","To better understand the effectiveness of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and to support improvement efforts aimed at enhancing its genuine effectiveness, this study proposes a novel approach to evaluating EIA effectiveness. The proposed framework was applied to the EIA system of Espírito Santo state, Southeastern Brazil. Unlike previous research, which often examined EIA effectiveness in isolation, this study introduces a comprehensive framework for a multifactorial analysis of EIA effectiveness (procedural, substantive, transactive, and legitimacy). By integrating various dimensions of EIA effectiveness and conducting a systematic longitudinal analysis from 2007 to 2016, this research provides insights into the effectiveness of the EIA process in the analyzed context. Grounded in multidimensional aspects of EIA effectiveness, our heuristic methodological framework facilitates an in-depth examination of the complexity of analyzing the effectiveness of EIA, aiming to provide efficient and adaptive responses. We analyzed forty-seven case studies through a combination of fieldwork and desk analysis, employing documentary research and interviews for data collection, and document analysis, discourse analysis, and statistical analysis for data analysis. Additionally, a meticulous quality review of all Environmental Impact Statements (EIS) produced during the study period significantly enhances our understanding of the EIA system's effectiveness. Our analysis reveals a notable gap in EIS quality, particularly regarding impact identification and analysis. These gaps, along with the subsequent need for supplementary information, contribute to prolonged durations and increased costs in EIA processes. Weaknesses were also identified in the screening and scoping phases of the EIA process. Despite these challenges, we identified knowledge repositories, instances of learning, and benefits that the EIA has brought to projects. Overall, this research represents a significant advancement in understanding EIA effectiveness, offering valuable insights for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers in the field. Additionally, the framework's adaptability to other contexts enhances its utility and relevance beyond the study area. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.", Brazil; Comprehensive analysis; Effectiveness; Environmental impact assessment; Framework; Understanding effectiveness,1.0
773,Life cycle assessment of municipal waste management options,"To date, landfilling remains the most common waste management practice in Greece in spite of enforced regulations aiming at increasing recycling, pre-selection of waste and energy and material recovery. In this study, selected alternative scenarios aiming at minimizing the unused material fraction to be disposed of in landfills are analyzed, using the life cycle assessment methodology. The methodology was applied in the case of municipal solid waste (MSW) management in Athens and Thessaloniki, with a special focus on energy and material balance, including potential global and local scale airborne emissions. Results are given in the form of indices efficiency, effectiveness, environmental and public health impacts. Material flow accounting, gross energy requirement, emergy intensity, emission and release intensity and morbidity or mortality indicators have been used to support the comparative assessment. However, not all options are equally benign to the local environment and to the health of the local population, since both the former and the latter are still affected by non-negligible local emissions. With regard to public health impacts, adverse effects on respiratory health, congenital malformations, low birth weight and cancer incidence were estimated. A significant and not intuitive result is the fact that life cycle analysis produces different conclusions than a simple environmental impact assessment based only on estimated or measured emissions. Taking into account the overall life cycle of both the waste streams and of the technological systems and facilities envisaged alters the relative attractiveness of the solutions considered. © 2020", Emergy synthesis; Energy analysis; Health impacts; Life cycle analysis; Material flow accounting; Urban solid waste management,0.0
774,HABSCORE - Applications and future developments of related habitat models,"1. The role of habitat evaluation methods (HEM) is briefly re in the context of contemporary fisheries management. Management requirements of HEMs for fisheries purposes include setting spawning targets, and assessing compliance against these targets, environmental impact assessment habitat protection and restoration, survey design, classification and reporting of fish and habitat resources. Currently available or emerging HEMs are compared against these management applications. 2. HABSCORE is a system of salmonid stream habitat measurement and evaluation based on empirical models of fish density against combinations of site and catchment features. An outline is provided of the derivation, performance and applications of HABSCORE. 3. The effectiveness of HABSCORE and other HEMs depends on their ability to explain the spatial component of variance seen in fish population data. Variance analysis of HABSCORE performance shows how the relative importance of spatial and temporal variance alters at different geographical scales, the latter (indicative of synchronous variation) being much more important within small tributaries. HEMs based only on catchment features explain significant proportions of spatial variance, demonstrating their potential in catchment-scale evaluation. 4. Other contemporary HEMs considered include PHABSIM, procedures to transport spawning targets between rivers, fisheries classification, and habitat evaluation for restoration purposes. All of these have limitations in the management of habitat at catchment scale. Future fisheries applications, such as setting spawning targets or integrated catchment management planning, will probably require some combination of GIS-based, extensive classification and site-based field observations of habitat quality. This approach is being developed through the Fisheries River Habitat Inventory which links HABSCORE to a national fisheries classification system.", Fisheries management; Habitat evaluation; River classification; Salmonids,1.0
775,The European Directive on environmental impact assessment: Implementation at last?,"The Commission of the European Communities' directive on environmental impact assessment (EIA) finally came into force in July 1988. The main provisions of the Directive are described, together with the objectives it is intended to achieve and the key areas where member state legislation will need to be effective if the principal requirements of the Directive are to be properly implemented. These include adequate coverage of projects, sufficient information in EIA studies, and effective consultation and public participation. Most European countries have some experience with EIA but, as illustrated by the UK Channel Fixed Link reports, the quality of the studies undertaken is very variable. Recommendations are made for improvements in practice through more effective diffusion of best practice, better provision and use of EIA guidance, more focused EIA research, more effective consultation and closer collaboration between the different parties involved in the EIA process, and both quantitative and qualitative improvements in EIA training. The results of a recent survey of European EIA training activity indicate growing interest, but further progress in improving the provision of EIA training is needed before the Directive can be effectively implemented. © 1988 Science and Technology Letters.", ,1.0
776,Sustainable geopolymers from polyethylene terephthalate waste and industrial by-products: a comprehensive characterisation and performance predictions,"Several researchers have recently worked to create sustainable building materials. One of the fundamental prerequisites for sustainable construction methods and environmental impact assessments is the use of green building materials and manufacturing processes. In this research study, geopolymer bricks were developed using polyethylene terephthalate waste and different industrial by-products (rice husk ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, red mud, construction, and demolition waste) and investigated their performances. The polyethylene terephthalate waste was used as a replacement for sand filler in the geopolymer brick up to 100%. Key findings include a workability decrease of 14.75% and a compressive strength reduction of up to 75% with 100% plastic waste replacement, attributed to increased voids and weak geopolymer matrix interaction. Dry density consistently decreases, and water absorption rises to 13.73% with full sand replacement, indicating a porous structure. Impact resistance improves with plastic waste inclusion, enhancing ductility and thermal conductivity by 57% at full replacement. Microstructural analyses reveal correlations between physical–mechanical properties and changes in porosity, microcracks, and bond strength. Machine learning, especially linear regression, proves effective for strength parameter prediction (up to 100% efficacy, R-square of 0.998). The promising results obtained could offer a substantial environmentally friendly solution to the building and construction industry in line with Circular Economy principles. © The Author(s) 2024.", ,0.0
777,"Energy, exergy and environmental impact analysis on the novel indirect solar dryer with fins inserted phase change material","Solar energy is a widely used green energy resource that is used for drying processes. Through this assessment, the performance of an Indirect Solar Dryer (ISD) with three different cases, namely solar collector - without Thermal Energy Storage (TES), with TES unit having Phase Change Material (PCM) and with TES having fins inserted PCM have been experimentally analyzed during spring and summer seasons for drying Momordica charantia. Totally six experiments were undertaken to compare temperature, drying kinetics, and energy analyses. The initial moisture level of 2 kg of specimen decreased from 1.84 kg of water (92% w. b) to 0.24 kg of water (12% w. b) in 10.5 h utilizing ISD with TES having fins inserted PCM (Test 6). The maximum thermal efficiency achieved about 19.41% on Test 6. Exergy efficiency increased from 8.66% to 79.02% at Test 6. Environmental impacts assessment has revealed that the Energy Payback Time for the ISD was 1.42 years. The CO2 emission, mitigation, and carbon credit gained (Test 6) are 23.88 kg/year, 20.13 tons, and $100.642 to $402.569 for the 35 years’ intended lifespan.

780,Environmental and sustainability impact assessment in small islands: The case of Azores and Madeira,"This paper compares Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) practices and effectiveness in the Portuguese islands of the Azores and Madeira. This was accomplished by qualitative appraisal and evaluation of the contents of EIA statements and the characterisation of the EIA practices. Data was collected from the islands' regional environmental agencies and from the Environmental Portuguese Agency internet database. The findings reveal that most EIA project practitioners and consultants in the islands are associated with the regional government agencies. Proposals were generally approved with 'conditions' and the diversity of project types were lower in the islands than in the mainland. There was limited follow-up on the EIA process so that evaluation of conditions compliance was scanty. Key areas identified for consideration in the development of good impact assessment practice in the islands included, the Islands' unique geographical and ecological characteristics, scale effects, intra-insular regional dimension, impact significance evaluation approaches, and training, education and development skills in EIA processes.

Monitoring the process of land-use/land-cover (LULC) transformations in these areas and knowing their driving forces would contribute to an informed decision making. In this study, an integrated application of satellite imagery interpretation and landscape ecology approach is implemented to quantify and analyze the landscape dynamics of Jajroud reservation area, Iran. The digital images collected by satellite at 1986, 2000, and 2010 were classified following an ensemble classification method. The resultant LULC maps included six categories of orchard, healthy rangeland, degraded rangeland, afforest, water, and urban. Landscape metrics-based analysis of temporal patterns of LULCs indicated that Jajroud reservation area has been undergoing rapid and drastic changes over the past 25 years. Based on class area metric at landscape level, changes were mostly due to the conversion of degraded rangeland and orchard to urban category. The impervious area expanded approximately fivefold from 1986 to 2010. Based on Largest Patch Index metric, the dominant land-cover class across the study time frame was degraded rangeland that decreased from 1986 to 2010. The main driving forces of urban growth in the area were willingness of local residents to sell their orchard lands and having financial interests. Because of rapid economic development and expansion of human-constructed elements, the landscape of the area experienced a fragmentation process during the last three decades. The study demonstrated that integrated application of satellite imagery and landscape metrics can be a useful and easy-to-implement tool for environmental impact assessment of an ongoing urbanization process. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.", Iran; Jajroud reservation area; Land-use change; Landscape metrics; Remote sensing,1.0
782,Life Cycle Comparison of Membrane Capacitive Deionization and Reverse Osmosis Membrane for Textile Wastewater Treatment,"The reduced natural water sources on the one hand and the large amount of wastewater produced by the textile industry on the other hand lead to the requirement of an effective reuse of textile wastewater. In this study, the treatment of textile wastewater by the reverse osmosis membrane system and membrane capacitive deionization (MCDI) system has been investigated to improve the quality and the recovery rate of the effluent for reclamation. The maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency obtained at 10 bar was 96.3% for BW30 reverse osmosis membrane. Diversified operating conditions, including working voltage and flow rate, were investigated systematically in the MCDI system which is an effective water purification technology. According to the obtained experimental results, the COD removal efficiency was thoroughly increased by rising the working voltage (from 0.2 to 1.2 V) and the flow rate (from 5 to 17.5 ml/min). The flow rate and the working voltage at which the COD from textile wastewater removal ratio was the highest were 10 ml/min and 1.2 V, respectively. A life cycle approach has also been implemented for the comparison of environmental impact assessment of the two desalination systems. In this study, a life cycle approach has been implemented for the comparison of environmental friendly impact assessment of the two desalination systems.

784,Providing ecological context to anthropogenic subsea noise: Assessing listening space reductions of marine mammals from tidal energy devices,"The deployment of tidal energy arrays is gaining momentum to provide marine renewable energy (MRE) to the global market. However, there are concerns over the potential impacts underwater noise emissions from operational devices may have on marine fauna. Auditory masking (the interference of important biological signals by anthropogenic noise) is a highly pervasive impact to marine fauna. We used a relatively new approach to evaluate the effects of noise from operational tidal energy devices on the listening space of marine mammals. Here, listening space reductions (LSR) for harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) and harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) were assessed in winter and summer for two tidal energy devices of different designs. Results demonstrated that LSR was influenced by type of turbine, species, and season. For instance, LSRs for harbour seals were in excess of 80% within 60 m, whilst for harbour porpoises they were in excess of 55% within 10 m of the devices. For both species, LSRs were highest during winter, characterised by low ambient noise conditions. These findings highlight the importance of assessing masking over seasons, as masking effects are highly influenced by ambient noise conditions. Understanding the natural variation within seasons is also particularly relevant for tidal turbine noise assessments as devices are typically situated in highly dynamic environments. Since masking effects occur at the lower level of behavioural impacts in marine mammals, assessing the spatial extent of masking as part of environmental impact assessments is recommended. The listening space formula, which is largely based on measurable environmental factors (device and ambient noise), is transferable to any MRE device, or arrays, for any species (for which an audiogram can be assumed) and therefore provides an effective method to better inform MRE pre- and post-consenting processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd", Acoustics; Harbour porpoise; Harbour seal; Hydrokinetics; Masking; Renewable energy,1.0
785,Performance of EIA authority and effectiveness of EIA system in Pakistan,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) agencies worldwide face multiple challenges that compromise their performance and in turn EIA procedural effectiveness. The current study aimed to evaluate the performance of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of Punjab, Pakistan and the problems it faces whilst implementing EIA and ensuring EIA effectiveness. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data for the study. EPA performance and procedural effectiveness were evaluated using the formal and informal roles of EPA and EIA good practices respectively. They were also linked to regulatory framework, capacities of actors and contextual factors. Study found that EPA and EIA system performance is weak. Consequently, procedural effectiveness is compromised. The main causes include limited capacities of EPA, consultants and proponents; lack of political will; political interference and outdated regulations. A strong political will of the government is required to enhance the capacity of EPA and other actors in terms of motivation or “the will to” and means or “the ability to”. Measures taken by international EIA agencies to improve performance and effectiveness have also been discussed. Based on this study, lessons can be learnt by not only EPA Punjab but also other agencies in Pakistan and international agencies facing similar challenges. © 2019", Capacities; EIA; EPA; Performance; Procedural effectiveness; Punjab,1.0

In this paper an overview of methods is provided and preliminary guidelines for the choice of methods are presented. The methods introduced include: Environmental Impact Assessment, Strategic Environmental Assessment, Life Cycle Assessment, Cost-Benefit Analysis, Cost-effectiveness Analysis, Life-cycle Costing, Risk Assessment, Material Flow Accounting, Substance Flow Analysis, Energy Analysis, Exergy Analysis, Entropy Analysis, Environmental Management Systems, and Environmental Auditing, The characteristics used are the types of impacts included, the objects under study and whether the method is procedural or analytical The different methods can be described as systems analysis methods. Waste management systems thinking is receiving increasing attention. This is, for example, evidenced by the suggested thematic strategy on waste by the European Commission where life-cycle analysis and life-cycle thinking get prominent positions. Indeed, life-cycle analyses have been shown to provide policy-relevant and consistent results. However, it is also clear that the studies will always be open to criticism since they are simplifications of reality and include uncertainties. This is something all systems analysis methods have in common. Assumptions can be challenged and it may be difficult to generalize from case studies to policies. This suggests that if decisions are going to be made, they are likely to be made on a less than perfect basis.", Economy; Environment; Models; Systems; wmr 1155-1,1.0
787,Impact of model parameterization on predictive uncertainty of regional groundwater models in the context of environmental impact assessment,"Parameterization strategy impacts models' outputs and the associated uncertainty. This is particularly true for transient regional groundwater models where parameters can only be weakly constrained by insufficient observations. However, this is rarely investigated under any particular model structure. This study bridges this gap using a regional groundwater model developed to understand the impact of coal seam gas extraction on groundwater systems in a probabilistic framework. Two different parameterization schemes were implemented for hydraulic conductivity and specific storage. The first method solely relies on the relationship between hydraulic properties and burial depths. The second more complex strategy allows more spatial variations of hydraulic parameters using pilot points. The study provides new insights and practical guidance on the application of groundwater modelling for environmental impact assessment. The results suggest that the choice of model parameterization has a significant influence on predictive uncertainty. The model using the simple parameterization provides predictions with a much wider range than the model with a more sophisticated parameterization. This is because that the lowly parameterized model tends to generate more extreme effective hydraulic parameter fields unless the parameterization simplification converts the inverse problem to a (close to) well-posed problem that rarely exists for applied regional groundwater modelling. The potential impact of model parameterization should be discussed explicitly in groundwater modelling applications to support decision making to avoid misinterpretation of the modelling results. © 2021", Groundwater modelling; Model complexity; Model parameterization; Model simplification; Uncertainty analysis,1.0
788,Development of building information modeling template for environmental impact assessment,"Eco-friendly building designs that use building information modeling (BIM) have become popular, and a variety of eco-friendly building assessment technologies that take advantage of BIM are being developed. However, existing building environmental performance assessment technologies that use BIM are linked to external assessment tools, and there exist compatibility issues among programs; it requires a considerable amount of time to address these problems, owing to the lack of experts who can operate the programs. This study aims to develop eco-friendly templates for assessing the embodied environmental impact of buildings using BIM authoring tools as part of the development of BIM-based building life cycle assessment (LCA) technologies. Therefore, an embodied environmental impact unit database was developed, for major building materials during production and operating stages, to perform embodied environmental impact assessments. Moreover, a major structural element library that uses the database was developed and a function was created to produce building environmental performance assessment results tables, making it possible to review the eco-friendliness of buildings. A case study analysis was performed to review the feasibility of the environmental performance assessment technologies. The results showed a less than 5% effective error rate in the assessment results that were obtained using the technology developed in this study compared with the assessment results based on the actual calculation and operating stage energy consumption figures, which proves the reliability of the proposed approach. © 2021 by the authors.

789,An approach to determine the quality of EIA reports of hydropower plants using analytic network process and fuzzy logic toolbox,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a precautionary and interlinked environmental regulation tool utilized by relevant authorities. Presently, there is no singular global set of EIA quality criteria to review the performances of the EIA reports on hydropower plants. In this paper, a new approach has been undertaken to create a well-organized objective type framework for a simple, fast, and comprehensive evaluation of the quality of a subjective type EIA report on a hydropower plant. In authors' previous research, for a quantitative performance evaluation of EIA reports, Fuzzy Logic Toolbox was used where nine attributes of an EIA report were selected as inputs, and the method was found to be effective. In this research, a detailed description of the rules for selecting the quality parameters for the attributes with different criteria are described with the objective type framework. With the help of Analytic Network Process (ANP), the importance score of each of the nine interrelated attributes is calculated, and these importance scores are used as the limits for the attributes (inputs) in Fuzzy Logic Toolbox. Considering the quality criteria and using “If-Then” expert rules, the final qualities of the attributes from a hydropower plant EIA report are determined, and by putting the final qualities of the attributes in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox, a final score indicating the overall quality of the report is obtained. The novel objective type framework and Fuzzy Logic Toolbox together can assist in reviewing the quality of a subjective EIA report in a faster, more comprehensive, and quantitative way. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.", Analytic network process; EIA report; Fuzzy logic toolbox; Hydropower plants; Quality,1.0
790,Detection of the rare Australian endemic blind cave eel (Ophisternon candidum) with environmental DNA: implications for threatened species management in subterranean environments,"The blind cave eel, Ophisternon candidum (Mees in J R Soc West Aust 45: 24–32,1962), is a rare groundwater inhabitant found in geographically isolated populations of north-west Australia. The species is listed as vulnerable under Commonwealth legislation and is a priority consideration when environmental disturbance by resource companies is proposed. Detection of this species for Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and monitoring is difficult because individuals are naturally rare or traditional sampling techniques are ineffective. To properly manage the species, information on population distribution and connectivity is critical. We sought to examine whether environmental DNA (eDNA) of O. candidum could be detected and whether positive detection was correlated with previous locations where the species had been physically caught. We developed new eDNA species-specific PCR assays to screen groundwater sampling points and we detected O. candidum DNA in three boreholes where the species has previously been collected and five additional groundwater sampling points. Our results demonstrated that the newly designed assays were effective for detecting this rare and vulnerable subterranean species. This work sets a benchmark for the application of eDNA species-specific PCR assays for EIA and monitoring, and has potential for these assays to be expanded more broadly to high-throughput eDNA metabarcoding for subterranean groundwater communities in the future. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.", Environmental Impact Assessment; Groundwater; Metabarcoding; Monitoring; Single-species detection assays; Stygofauna,1.0
791,Getting to the real EIA,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been incorporated into the UK land use regime and presents an opportunity for ensuring that socio-environmental impacts are properly integrated into land use proposals. Public participation in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is regarded as essential in securing more accurate environmental statements, and in turn, more informed decision-making. Yet after nearly two decades of legislation and guidance on EIA, it is argued that effective participation in major land use decisions remains illusory. The value, the meaning, and the various levels of public involvement in EIA are analysed, together with the difficulties of getting EIA into decision-making. Emerging international obligations, especially under the Aarhus Convention and the proposed EC Public Participation Directive may have significant implication for current practice. Some progress has been made, but meaningful public participation in EIA remains elusive.", ,1.0
793,Effectiveness in NEPA decision making: in search of evidence and theory,"The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 requires federal agencies to analyze the environmental impacts of proposed actions that could impact the human environment, as well as consult the public before determining whether to proceed. Despite many thousands of environmental reviews over a 50-year history, there remains limited understanding of what NEPA has achieved and the factors that contribute to effective environmental review. While NEPA has been the subject of many empirical studies, this scholarship only rarely makes use of theories that would help scholars predict whether and why environmental impact assessment processes are effective. To aid scholars in the ongoing effort to assess NEPA’s effectiveness, we connect the literature on environmental impact assessment with social science concepts and theories that can improve scholars’ ability to explain whether and why environmental impact assessment practices are effective. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.", environmental decision making; environmental impact assessment; NEPA,1.0
794,On combination rule in Dempster–Shafer theory using OWA-based soft likelihood functions and its applications in environmental impact assessment,"Dempster–Shafer theory (DST) was presented as an effective mathematical tool to represent uncertainty. Its significant innovation is to allow the allocation of the belief of mass to sets or intervals, and it becomes a valuable method in the field of decision making and evaluation when accurate information is not available or when knowledge is expressed subjectively by humans. A crucial research issue in DST is the combination of multi-sources of evidence. In this paper, a novel combination rule for Dempster–Shafer structures is developed based on ordered weighted average (OWA)-based soft likelihood functions proposed by Yager. First, the belief intervals, including the belief measures and plausibility measures, of all the hypotheses in the frame of discernment (FOD) are calculated. Second, the representative value of belief interval is defined based on golden rule introduced by Yager. Third, the soft likelihood value of each hypothesis is calculated based on the proposed OWA-based soft likelihood function for belief interval, which can be considered as the combined evidence. The final evaluation results can be employed for practical applications, such as decision making and evaluation. In addition, the improved evidence combination rule is presented which takes into account the weight of evidence. Several illustrative examples are conducted to manifest the use of the developed methods. Finally, an application for environmental impact assessment is given to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed combination rule in DST. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", Dempster–Shafer theory; environmental impact assessment; evidence combination; golden rule; ordered weighted average (OWA); soft likelihood function,1.0
795,Better cars or older cars?: Assessing CO2 emission reduction potential of passenger vehicle replacement programs,"The primary motivation for the vehicle replacement schemes that were implemented in many countries was to encourage the purchase of new cars. The basic assumption of these schemes was that these acquisitions would benefit both the economy and the environment as older and less fuel-efficient cars were scrapped and replaced with more fuel-efficient models. In this article, we present a new environmental impact assessment method for assessing the effectiveness of scrappage schemes for reducing CO2 emissions taking into account the rebound effect, driving behavior for older versus new cars and entire lifecycle emissions for during the manufacturing processes of new cars. The assessment of the Japanese scrappage scheme shows that CO2 emissions would only decrease if users of the scheme retained their new gasoline passenger vehicles for at least 4.7 years. When vehicle replacements were restricted to hybrid cars, the reduction in CO2 achieved by the scheme would be 6-8.5 times higher than the emissions resulting from a scheme involving standard, gasoline passenger vehicles. Cost-benefit analysis, based on the emission reduction potential, showed that the scheme was very costly. Sensitivity analysis showed that the Japanese government failed to determine the optimum, or target, car age for scrapping old cars in the scheme. Specifically, scrapping cars aged 13 years and over did not maximize the environmental benefits of the scheme. Consequently, modifying this policy to include a reduction in new car subsidies, focused funding for fuel-efficient cars, and modifying the target car age, would increase environmental benefits. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", Climate change mitigation; CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; Cost-benefit analysis; Life cycle assessment; Rebound effect; Vehicle replacement schemes,0.0
796,Comparative LCAs for curbside recycling versus either landfilling or incineration with energy recovery,"Background. This article describes two projects conducted recently by Sound Resource Management (SRMG) - one for the San Luis Obispo County Integrated Waste Management Authority (SLO IWMA) and the other for the Washington State Department of Ecology (WA Ecology). For both projects we used life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques to evaluate the environmental burdens associated with collection and management of municipal solid waste. Both projects compared environmental burdens from curbside collection for recycling, processing, and market shipment of recyclable materials picked up from households and/or businesses against environmental burdens from curbside collection and disposal of mixed solid waste. Methodology. The SLO IWMA project compared curbside recycling for households and businesses against curbside collection of mixed refuse for deposition in a landfill where landfill gas is collected and used for energy generation. The WA Ecology project compared residential curbside recycling in three regions of Washington State against the collection and deposition of those same materials in landfills where landfill gas is collected and flared. In the fourth Washington region (the urban east encompassing Spokane) the WA Ecology project compared curbside recycling against collection and deposition in a waste-to-energy (WTE) combustion facility used to generate electricity for sale on the regional energy grid. During the time period covered by the SLO study, households and businesses used either one or two containers, depending on the collection company, to separate and set out materials for recycling in San Luis Obispo County. During the time of the WA study households used either two or three containers for the residential curbside recycling programs surveyed for that study. Typically participants in collection programs requiring separation of materials into more than one container used one of the containers to separate at least glass bottles and jars from other recyclable materials. For the WA Ecology project SRMG used life cycle inventory (LCI) techniques to estimate atmospheric emissions of ten pollutants, waterborne emissions of seventeen pollutants, and emissions of industrial solid waste, as well as total energy consumption, associated with curbside recycling and disposal methods for managing municipal solid waste. Emissions estimates came from the Decision Support Tool (DST) developed for assessing the cost and environmental burdens of integrated solid waste management strategies by North Carolina State University (NCSU) in conjunction with Research Triangle Institute (RTI) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). RTI used the DST to estimate environmental emissions during the life cycle of products. RTI provided those estimates to SRMG for analysis in the WA Ecology project. For the SLO IWMA project SRMG also used LCI techniques and data from the Municipal Solid Waste Life-Cycle Database (Database), prepared by RTI with the support of US EPA during DST model development, to estimate environmental emissions from solid waste management practices. Once we developed the LCI data for each project, SRMG then prepared a life cycle environmental impacts assessment of the environmental burdens associated with these emissions using the Environmental Problems approach discussed in the methodology section of this article. Finally, for the WA study we also developed estimates of the economic costs of certain environmental impacts in order to assess whether recycling was cost effective from a societal point of view. Conclusions. Recycling of newspaper, cardboard, mixed paper, glass bottles and jars, aluminum cans, tin-plated steel cans, plastic bottles, and other conventionally recoverable materials found in house-hold and business municipal solid wastes consumes less energy and imposes lower environmental burdens than disposal of solid waste materials via landfilling or incineration, even after accounting for energy that may be recovered from waste materials at either type disposal facility. This result holds for a variety of environmental impacts, including global warming, acidification, eutrophication, disability adjusted life year (DALY) losses from emission of criteria air pollutants, human toxicity and ecological toxicity. The basic reason for this conclusion is that energy conservation and pollution prevention engendered by using recycled rather than virgin materials as feedstocks for manufacturing new products tends to be an order of magnitude greater than the additional energy and environmental burdens imposed by curbside collection trucks, recycled material processing facilities, and transportation of processed recyclables to end-use markets. Furthermore, the energy grid offsets and associated reductions in environmental burdens yielded by generation of energy from landfill gas or from waste combustion are substantially smaller then the upstream energy and pollution offsets attained by manufacturing products with processed recyclables, even after accounting for energy usage and pollutant emissions during collection, processing and transportation to end-use markets for recycled materials. The analysis that leads to this conclusion included a direct comparison of the collection for recycling versus collection for disposal of the same quantity and composition of materials handled through existing curbside recycling programs in Washington State. This comparison provides a better approximation to marginal energy usage and environmental burdens of recycling versus disposal for recyclable materials in solid waste than does a comparison of the energy and environmental impacts of recycling versus management methods for handling typical mixed refuse, where that refuse includes organics and non-recyclables in addition to whatever recyclable materials may remain in the garbage. Finally, the analysis also suggests that, under reasonable assumptions regarding the economic cost of impacts from pollutant emissions, the societal benefits of recycling outweigh its costs. © 2005 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).", Combustion; Emissions valuation; Energy conservation; Incineration; Landfill; LCA; LCI; Lifecycle; Pollutant valuation; Pollution prevention; Recycling; Resource conservation; Waste-to-energy,0.0
797,"AHP-GP approach by considering the leopold matrix for sustainable water reuse allocation: Najafabad case study, Iran","Water reuse allocation is one of the major challenges in water resource management which requires the assessment of water reuse alternatives, especially in regions with limitation in water resources, arid climates, population growth and increasing water demand. Considering the complexity of the problem, water reuse allocation by using conventional methods for maximizing benefits, minimizing cost and environmental risks, cannot guarantee optimal allocation. In this paper, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) which can be combined with Goal Programming (GP) by considering the Leopold matrix for carrying-out the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is used for sustainable water reuse allocation for multiple stakeholders in Najafabad as a case study. The results show that the developed mathematical model with combination of quantitative evaluation and optimization can be considered as an effective and flexible tool for creating better guidelines to adapt the requirements of various stakeholders for better allocation of recycled water.

A robust follow-up scheme was the main driver for the successful implementation of mitigation measures. Follow-up costs represented 1.4% of total project costs. Some lessons learned could form recommendations for similar projects: a management system is a powerful tool to implement mitigation and other management measures; checklists and audit protocols can be a practical solution to ‘translate’ the terms and conditions of the environmental license into enforceable, manageable and verifiable rules; external control is essential to guarantee successful implementation of mitigation measures. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", Cost; Effectiveness; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental management system; Follow-up; Highways; Impact audit; Impact mitigation,1.0

802,Effectiveness of Environmental Impact Assessment follow-up as a tool for environmental management: lessons and insights from platinum mines along the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe,"The concept of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) follow-up has received considerable attention in recent years. However, a number of EIA practitioners have pointed out that there is lack of EIA follow-up evidence on the effectiveness of implemented mitigation measures in practice. This study examined EIA follow-up evidence of implemented mitigation measures and their effectiveness in protecting the environment from platinum mining and processing plants operating along the Great Dyke of Zimbabwe. Using data from environmental impact statements; environmental management plans, environment monitoring reports; and views of environmental managers and selected local residents, and field observations, the study examined the utility of EIA follow-up as a tool for enhancing the effectiveness of implemented mitigation measures. The results show that EIA follow-ups are carried out with emphasis being given to procedures. The adverse impacts of sulphur dioxide; dust and noise on local residents’ health around the platinum smeltering plant put into question the sustainability of current mitigation measures. The paper overall argues that a lot more needs to be done to bridge the gap between the current state of EIA follow-up in Zimbabwe and international best practices regarding the substantive dimension of EIA effectiveness. Using results from the study, the paper highlights the limitations of the current approach to follow-up conceptualization and suggests ways to strengthen the overall effectiveness of EIA. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", Effectiveness; EIA follow-up; Great Dyke; Mitigation; Zimbabwe,1.0

increased development of public policy, lending standards, and corporate practices. With interest in biodiversity offsets
increasing in Latin America, we seek to strengthen the basis for policy development through a review of major
environmental licensing policy frameworks in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela. Here we
focused our review on an examination of national level policies to evaluate to which degree current provisions promote
positive environmental outcomes. All the surveyed countries have national-level Environmental Impact Assessment laws or
regulations that cover the habitats present in their territories. Although most countries enable the use of offsets only Brazil,
Colombia, Mexico and Peru explicitly require their implementation. Our review has shown that while advancing quite
detailed offset policies, most countries do not seem to have strong requirements regarding impact avoidance. Despite this
deficiency most countries have a strong foundation from which to develop policy for biodiversity offsets, but several issues
require further guidance, including how best to: (1) ensure conformance with the mitigation hierarchy; (2) identify the most

literature. We do so by first exploring ‘outside’ the IA literature, identifying three main themes of uncertainty

Based on a search of the database Scopus, we identified 134 journal papers published between 1970 and 2013
that address uncertainty in IA, 75% of which were published since 2005. We found that 90% of IA research addressing
uncertainty focused on uncertainty in the practice of IA, including uncertainty in impact predictions,
models and managing environmental impacts. Notwithstanding early guidance on uncertainty treatment in IA
from the 1980s, we found no common, underlying conceptual framework that was guiding research on uncertainty
in IA practice. Considerably less attention, only 9% of papers, focused on uncertainty communication, disclosure
and decision-making under uncertain conditions, the majority of which focused on the need to disclose
uncertainties as opposed to providing guidance on how to do so and effectively use that information to inform
decisions. Finally, research focused on theory building for explaining human behaviorwith respect to uncertainty
avoidance constituted only 1% of the IA published literature.We suggest the need for further conceptual framework
development for researchers focused on identifying and addressing uncertainty in IA practice; the need for
guidance on how best to communicate uncertainties in practice, versus criticizing practitioners for not doing so;

4,"Different bottom trawl fisheries have a differential impact on
the status of the North Sea seafloor habitats","Fisheries using bottom trawls are the most widespread source of anthropogenic physical disturbance to seafloor habitats. To mitigate such
disturbances, the development of fisheries-, conservation-, and ecosystem-based management strategies requires the assessment of the impact
of bottom trawling on the state of benthic biota. We explore a quantitative and mechanistic framework to assess trawling impact. Pressure
and impact indicators that provide a continuous pressure–response curve are estimated at a spatial resolution of 1 1 min latitude and lon-
gitude (2 km 2) using three methods: L1 estimates the proportion of the community with a life span exceeding the time interval between
trawling events; L2 estimates the decrease in median longevity in response to trawling; and population dynamic (PD) estimates the decrease
in biomass in response to trawling and the recovery time. Although impact scores are correlated, PD has the best performance over a broad
range of trawling intensities. Using the framework in a trawling impact assessment of ten me ́tiers in the North Sea shows that muddy habitats
are impacted the most and coarse habitats are impacted the least. Otter trawling for crustaceans has the highest impact, followed by otter
trawling for demersal fish and beam trawling for flatfish and flyshooting. Beam trawling for brown shrimps, otter trawling for industrial fish,
and dredging for molluscs have the lowest impact. Trawling is highly aggregated in core fishing grounds where the status of the seafloor is
low but the catch per unit of effort (CPUE) per unit of impact is high, in contrast to peripheral grounds, where CPUE per unit of impact is

MPA impacts are important to consider when designing, implementing, and managing MPAs. However,
the currently available knowledge about these areas and especially of stakeholder perceptions is scarce
and limited to restricted geographic areas. The present study aims to address this gap by examining these
factors in the Mediterranean and Black Seas using an extensive literature review and an online survey
approach. We collated and examined a total of 208 published studies on socioeconomic impacts of MPAs
and marine uses. We found that for fishing, the socioeconomic impacts of MPAs were generally perceived
as negative for industrial fishing and positive for artisanal fishing. In the online survey, we collected ca.
100 responses and found that stakeholder perceptions on the impacts of MPAs differ across sectors and
regions. Industrial fishing was perceived as being negatively impacted in the Black Sea, while most re-
spondents from the Mediterranean Sea were neutral in their responses relating industrial fishing and
MPAs. The impact of MPAs on artisanal and recreational fishing was generally viewed as neutral by
respondents from the Black Sea, whereas most Mediterranean respondents indicated a positive impact of
MPAs. We also found that perceptions of the major threats to MPAs differed across the Mediterranean
and the Black Sea. Responses from the Black Sea were systematically shifted towards a more negative
perception of threats to MPAs compared to those from the Mediterranean Sea. Illegal fishing and other
illegal activities were considered to be the most relevant threats to MPAs by stakeholders in both regions.
The mismatch found between evidence of MPA effectiveness and impacts from the scientific literature
and the results of our survey suggests that within the framework of maritime spatial planning and

The review introduces and illustrates the LCA framework, and highlights energy use by fishing vessels, among other key factors determining environmental impacts of fisheries operations. Moreover, the review concludes with recommendations on future developments of LCA in the fisheries and seafood sectors.
We reviewed 16 studies on LCA applied to fisheries, with perspectives from a few additional publications on closely related topics. The main Aspects considered in the ad hoc comparison of studies include: scope and system boundaries, functional units, allocation strategies for co-products, conventional and fishery-specific impact categories used, fuel use, impact assessment methods, level of detail in inventories, normalisation of results and sensitivity analyses.
A number of patterns and singularities were detected. Fishery-specific impact categories, despite not being standardised, and fuel use in fishing operations were identified as the main contributors to environmental impacts. Energy efficiency was found to be strongly related to the fishing gear used. Several studies discussed the impacts of antifouling substances and metals use. The need for standardisation of fisheries LCA research is justified and ideas on how to do so and what elements to standardise (fisheries-specific impact categories, inventory details, normalisation references, etc.) are discussed. Finally, fisheries LCA constitute a useful research field when studying the sustainability of seafood and fisheries-based agrifood, and it should likewise contribute to an ecosystem approach to fisheries","Allocation, energy, environmental impacts, fisheries, life cycle assessment ",0.0

We present the PlanWise4Blue tool (PW4B), which assesses the cumulative effects of multiple pressures on nature assets. In order to express the sensitivity of different nature assets to a plethora of pressure combinations, a meta-analysis based on published literature and available datasets was performed to calculate a set of standardized effect sizes. These calculations relied mostly on experimental or observational evidence; expert knowledge was used to estimate the impact coefficients only in the absence of impact data. Spatial modelling techniques (machine learning) were used to model the probability of occurrence and abundances of different nature assets in lattice grids with a cell size of 1 km2. Users can use the portal to estimate impacted areas and changes to natural assets caused by any combination of anthropogenic pressure. The PW4B tool can be used to predict individual and synergistic effects — both current and future — of a wide range of human activities and can be used regardless of scientific background. The tool was tested in the Baltic Sea region in coordination with the process of the Estonian Maritime Spatial Planning. This test evaluated the combined effects of human activity such as fisheries, aquaculture, wind energy, mining and maritime transport sectors on nature assets such as selected seaweed, invertebrate, fish habitats as well as bird and mammal species. The analyses showed that current Estonian maritime spatial planning will result in a moderate loss of some nature assets and a significant gain of benthic suspension feeders, although predicted losses in wind park areas can be mitigated if novel aquaculture activities such as mussel or macroalgal farming are established This test demonstrates how the PW4B tool can be used by planners to minimize adverse environmental effects, to suggest effective mitigation strategy, and to attain sustainable planning solutions.",Decision support toolsMaritime spatial planningPlanWise4BlueCumulative effects assessment (CEA)Baltic sea ,1.0

urban agglomeration","Black carbon (BC) is a vital air pollution particulate. Urban agglomeration has complex trade linkages internally
and externally. Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ) is the largest urban agglomeration in northern China and suffers from severe air
pollution problems. Despite the importance of BC mitigation and the study area of JJJ, there is a lack of studies
exploring the embodied BC emission transfers hidden behind trade within and across the JJJ urban agglomer-
ation at the city scale, given the importance of interregional collaboration among cities for air pollution control.
This paper applied the multiregional input-output (MRIO) analysis and structure path analysis (SPA) to inves-
tigate the impact of trade on the BC emissions in JJJ and identify the critical sectors and supply chains, using the
latest available China’s city-level MRIO table. The results show that the embodied BC emission intensity in JJJ is
143.17 g/104 yuan, which exceeds the national average (121.89 g/104 yuan). The Construction sector con-
tributes 27.93 % of the total embodied BC emissions in JJJ. The cities of Handan, Tangshan, and Hengshui are
the largest providers of emission-intensive products (3.51, 2.83, and 2.05 Gg, respectively) while Beijing is the
largest receiver (5.78 Gg). From a supply chain perspective, Coal and Metal Mining are the main upstream in-
dustries, accounting for a considerable proportion of the BC emissions supply chain. To enhance the interregional
collaborative governance of BC pollution control in JJJ, horizontal governance mechanisms, decentralized and
polycentric urban planning, industrial clustering and technology upgrading, and effective policies for specific

12,Is the environmental policies procedures a barrier to development of inland navigation and port management? A case of study in Brazil,"The main objective of this article is to discuss the Brazilian environmental legislation and policies towards the development of navigation and port management. The research illustrated some difficulties faced by the country and make suggestions to overcome it. The construction of the environmental legal framework began in the early 1960s and resulted in a very complex system, as a consequence of policies adopted by the country. Nowadays Brazilian environmental policies are developed in democratic and participative way, although with elevated degree of bureaucracy and lack of integration among the several governmental agencies, which makes the approval of environmental certifications demand several years for new port projects or improvements, which delays the economic development of the country. Efforts have been made to simplify the licensing process. As result of this research two flowchart for environmental licenses of ports installation are shown: The first shows the process until 2009 and the second shows the process nowadays. This become an important issue due the fact that inland navigation is one of the less pollutant modes of transportation, and although, the process of environmental certification was simplified, if compare with 2009, it is still complex and time-consuming, delaying the development of the infrastructure.",The environmental permitting process are time-consuming. ► Environmental permitting postpone the implementation of infrastructure for inland navigation. ► The approval of some projects could demand decades. ► The Brazilian environmental permitting process has been simplified. ,1.0

falls well behind conceptual ideals. We argue that such dimplementation deficitsT reflect dilemmas between
two key rationales for scoping—environmental precaution and decision-making efficiency—and between
technical and participatory conceptions of the decision-making process. We use qualitative research to
understand how scoping practice in the UK reconciles these competing imperatives. Our findings suggest
that practitioners mainly rationalise their approach in terms of decision-making efficiency, while justifying
excluding the public from scoping on grounds of prematurity, delay and risks of causing confusion. The
tendency to scope issues in rather than exclude them reflects a pervasive concern for legal challenge, rather
than environmental precaution, but this reinforces standard lists of environmental considerations rather than
the investigation of novel, cumulative or indirect risks.",EIA; Scoping; Precautionary principle; Efficiency; Participation ,1.0

PROJECTS IN THE NETHERLANDS","This article discusses recent developments in integrated planning for the national road
infrastructure in the Netherlands. It lays emphasis on project definition as a “missing link”
between strategic planning and operational planning.
Road development projects may have considerable negative impacts. Projects, however,
are often too narrowly focused on road (re)construction alternatives and pay too less attention
to the relationships with other spatial developments. As a consequence, the scope of project
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) is too narrow and opportunities are missed to
enhance the spatial and environmental quality of the regions concerned. These problems
are best tackled early in the planning process when the “degrees of freedom” in shaping the
project are relatively large.
Using the case of the A27 motorway a new guideline for explorative studies is introduced.
The instrument described (called “reconnaissance study”) aims to connect the planning
arenas of Strategic Environmental Assessment and EIA, thus achieving more sustainable
planning. It focuses on the early stage of project development in which the scope of projects
is defined by “zooming in” from the national to a regional setting and translation of abstract
policy goals to a “real world” situation. Key elements are a transparent process in which

18,Evolution or revolution? Reflecting on IA effectiveness in Thailand,"This paper investigates whether the Thai impact assessment (IA) system should develop
through revolution or evolution. A timeline of the Thai IA system is mapped to show its
development to date. Aspects of effectiveness (i.e. procedural, substantive, transactive, and
legitimacy) are then used as the benchmark against which to evaluate past IA practice in
terms of strengths, limitations and challenges. IA practice is analysed both in terms of the
people within the IA system and the IA system itself, as both are considered key elements in
making IA work. The findings suggest that the ongoing evolution of the IA system has
continued to improve its procedural, substantive and transactive effectiveness; therefore,
suggesting that continuing evolution is sufficient to deliver these dimensions of effectiveness.
However, the findings also indicate that it is the people in the IA system that influence
practice and arbitrate legitimacy. Developing the system over time has not significantly
improved legitimacy, leading to the conclusion that gaining legitimacy in the IA process

assessment framework using agent-based simulation","Aims: Railway station areas can play a crucial role in promoting sustainable development if integrated with cities 
and be fluctuation-responsive through effective urban design. However, during the design stage, assessing the 
station areas’  performance, of which user satisfaction is indicative, is challenging due to methodological limi-tations. Agent-based simulation (ABS) is promising as it can link spatial features with agents’ behavior features. 
This research questions to what extent ABS can help assess the urban design of station areas.
Methods: This paper adopts the user pyramid as the theoretical framework, which outlines five types of user 
needs: safety, speed, ease, comfort, and experience. The paper selects indicators linking satisfaction and spatial 
features at the district and building levels. These indicators are measured in the simulation of the station system 
using digital tools, including MassMotion and Python scripts. The theory, indicators, and tools, in combination, 
serve as an assessment framework. Rotterdam Central Station is used as a case to demonstrate how the frame-work works.
Results: The framework is capable of assessing design alternatives by identifying changes in user satisfaction. It 
can be applied on the district level (at a scale of 250 m) with substantial details to inform design decision- 
making, and it is useful during the design stage when only limited data is available. This paper strengthens

Considering the scenario of major undertakings in the country, broadening the outlook on the health and environment relationship based on social and economic development processes striving for environmentally sustainable projects is a key strategy. This article examines the debate on the relationship between the current development model, the risks, the environment and health and discusses the importance of the participation of the health sector in the environmental licensing procedures, which is the instrument of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Seeking to create more environmentally and socially sustainable territories, the health sector has been looking for opportunities to participate in the licensing processes of major undertakings from the EIA standpoint. Results of research conducted by the Ministry of Health have demonstrated the form of participation in these processes, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses that favor or hinder the increase of preventive actions in public health in the implementation of major undertakings in Brazil.","Environmental licensing, Health, Major undertakings, Sustainability ",1.0

24,On legitimacy in impact assessment: An epistemologically-based conceptualisation,"Impact assessment (IA) is carried out as an ex ante process to inform decision-making. It includes requirements
for engagement with stakeholders (including the public) regarding actions proposed by a proponent. A key issue
with the various stakeholders involved is the perceived legitimacy of the IA, which can have implications both
for the reputation of the proponent, and the likelihood of conflict over the decision. But the understanding of
legitimacy in the IA literature has changed over time in line with an ontological shift from positivism (that
scientifically generated information leads to better informed decisions) to the post-positivist acknowledgement
of the limitations of scientific method whereby assumptions must be subject to transparency, deliberation and
openness. This has led to an epistemological shift towards greater subjectivism which, we suggest, has created
new opportunities (which have been realised in political decision-making) to subvert knowledge through the
increased use of the Internet and social media. To address the potential for such subversion of legitimacy, we
seek to conceptualise legitimacy in the IA context through framing IA around a critical realist ontology and a
reliabilist virtue epistemology. This allows us to identify ‘knowledge legitimacy’ as an equally important component
of IA legitimacy along with organisational legitimacy. We conceptualise knowledge legitimacy through
literature review drawing on rich understandings of knowledge from IA and other fields of research in order to
develop a four-dimensional typology. This includes the dimensions of: knowledge accuracy; knowledge restriction;
knowledge diffusion; and knowledge spectrum. This is the first theoretically grounded attempt to
understand legitimacy in IA. It is hoped that it will provoke discussion in the IA community to further advance
theoretical understandings of IA and legitimacy of practice.","Knowledge

25,Indigenous protected areas in Sea Country: Indigenous‐driven collaborative marine protected areas in Australia,"In many parts of the world, policymakers, legislators, marine managers, and
indigenous peoples have attempted to reconcile marine protected area (MPA)
governance and management with indigenous peoples' ancient and ongoing traditional
ownership of coastal and marine environments. This paper describes a novel
approach in Australia to addressing this challenge through indigenous‐led planning
and collaborative governance of holistic coastal land and sea indigenous protected
areas (IPAs) based on the indigenous concept of “Country”—traditional land and
sea estates and their associated cultural, environmental, and other values.
2. To provide context to this approach, the paper explains the concept of “Sea
Country” and provides an overview of the relationship between indigenous peoples
and Australia's coastal and marine environments, the legal and policy recognition of
Indigenous Sea Country rights and interests, and the engagement of indigenous
people in the governance and management of government‐led, legislated MPAs in
Australia.
3. The paper then describes the evolution of IPAs from being specifically based on
indigenous land tenure to being based more generally on Indigenous Country,
across multiple tenures, including marine areas. In recent years, IPAs based on
Country have enabled indigenous people to lead planning and governance of land and sea areas over which they have limited legal rights, including over existing
national parks and marine parks. Using this approach, some IPAs complement
existing protected area governance and management arrangements, whereas elsewhere
Country‐based IPAs are adding significantly to Australia's MPA estate. The
Dhimurru IPA in the Northern Territory and Girringun Region IPAs in Queensland
are presented as examples of this Country‐based approach.
4. This indigenous‐driven, collaborative, nonlegislative approach to dedicating,
governing and managing coastal areas and MPAs may serve as a model in other
nation states for indigenous people wishing to use a protected area governance
framework to support the contemporary management of their traditional marine
and coastal estates.","Australia, collaborative governance, indigenous, marine planning, marine protected areas, sea

expansion patterns?—Evidence from the Yangtze River Delta region, China","Urban expansion is considered to be a major driver of ecosystem services (ESs) loss, and variation of ESs in
rapidly urbanizing areas are of great concern. Clarifying the relationship between urban expansion and
ecosystem services (ESs) and understanding the impact of socio-ecological drivers on ESs are crucial for sus-
tainable urban development and ecological conservation. However, the differential impacts of urban expansion
on the variation of ecosystem services across different urban expansion patterns and the dominant drivers of
these variation, have not been fully explored, hampering the formulation of sustainable urban development
plans. To address these knowledge gaps, we assessed the differential impact of three urban expansion patterns
(edge-spreading, interior-filling and leap-frogging) on five representative ESs—carbon sequestration, food pro-
duction, habitat quality, soil retention and water yield—in the Yangtze River Delta region (YRDR) of China. We
applied random forest model to quantify the impact of ten social-ecological drivers on the variation of ESs across
three urban expansion patterns. Our findings revealed that edge-spreading is the main pattern of urban
expansion and it leads to higher losses of the three key ESs, which is therefore more significant than that caused
by interior-filling and leap-frogging. Although the loss of ESs due to urban expansion was primarily driven by
changes in natural drivers, social drivers had a variable and sometimes powerful influence on ESs. The differ-
ences in the impact of dominant socio-ecological drivers on the variation of ESs across different expansion
patterns are mainly reflected in the relative importance. Moreover, the overall explanatory power of socio-
ecological drivers on the variation of ESs under leap-frogging expansion was low. We suggest that different
ESs protection strategies should be developed and implemented for different urban expansion patterns to achieve
a balance between urban development and ecosystem protection. This study can provide an opportunity to
formulate refined urban development plans for the sustainable development of human-environment systems in

environmental impacts. As a prevention strategy, such activities are subjected to the process of Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA). Still, the follow-up of Environmental Management Plans or mitigation measures is lim-

36,"Farm-scale models in fish aquaculture –An overview of
methods and applications","Modelsare important toolsto address sustainability challenges associated with developing
aquaculture at farm, regional and global scales. Farm-scale models (FSMs), which are inte-
grated mathematical models developed to simulate farm operations, can quantify energy,
mass or economic input flows and predict a variety of outputs such as fish biomass, waste
and by-products. The variety of farming systems, equations available to build the models,
and objectives of applications and intended users has resulted in the publication of wide
range of FSMs. We performed a narrative review of 36 fish FSMs published from 1985–
2021 to address several questions: Can the main characteristics of these models be
defined? How do the farming system studied and the objectives of the study influence
model development? What are the main modelling techniques available to simulate the
main processes of a fish farm, and what are their advantages and disadvantages? How can
FSMs help address sustainability challenges of aquaculture? This review discusses
advances, limitations and future lines of research related to FSMs to help select existing
models, or develop new ones, that are suitable for their intended use and users. The article

37,Impacts of local human activities on the Antarctic environment,"We review the scientific literature, especially from the past decade, on the impacts of human
activities on the Antarctic environment. A range of impacts has been identified at a variety of spatial and
temporal scales. Chemical contamination and sewage disposal on the continent have been found to be
long-lived. Contemporary sewage management practices at many coastal stations are insufficient to prevent
local contamination but no introduction of non-indigenous organisms through this route has yet been
demonstrated. Human activities, particularly construction and transport, have led to disturbances of flora
and fauna. A small number of non-indigenous plant and animal species has become established, mostly on
the northern Antarctic Peninsula and southern archipelagos of the Scotia Arc. There is little indication of
recovery of overexploited fish stocks, and ramifications of fishing activity on bycatch species and the
ecosystem could also be far-reaching. The Antarctic Treaty System and its instruments, in particular the
Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and the Environmental Protocol,
provide a framework within which management of human activities take place. In the face of the
continuing expansion of human activities in Antarctica, a more effective implementation of a wide range of
measures is essential, in order to ensure comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment, including
its intrinsic, wilderness and scientific values which remains a fundamental principle of the Antarctic Treaty
System. These measures include effective environmental impact assessments, long-term monitoring,
mitigation measures for non-indigenous species, ecosystem-based management of living resources, and
increased regulation of National Antarctic Programmes and tourism activities","Antarctic Treaty System, contamination, ecosystem based management, human impacts,

39,"The Insignificance of Thresholds in Environmental Impact
Assessment: An Illustrative Case Study in Canada","Environmental assessment is the process that decision-makers rely on to predict, evaluate, and prevent biophysical, social,
and economic impacts of potential project developments. The determination of significance in environmental assessment is
central to environmental management in many nations. We reviewed ten recent environmental impact assessments from
British Columbia, Canada and systematically reviewed and scored significance determination and the approaches used by
assessors, the use of thresholds in significance determination, threshold exceedances, and the outcomes. Findings of
significant impacts were exceedingly rare and practitioners used a combination of significance determination approaches,
most commonly relying upon reasoned argumentation. Quantitative thresholds were rarely employed, with less than 10% of
the valued components evaluated using thresholds. Even where quantitative thresholds for significance were exceeded, in
every case practitioners used a variety of rationales to demote negative impacts to non-significance. These reasons include
combinations of scale (temporal and spatial) of impacts, an already exceeded baseline, model uncertainty and/or substituting
less stringent thresholds. Governments and agencies can better protect resources by requiring clear and defensible
significance determinations, by making government-defined thresholds legally enforceable and accountable, and by
requiring or encouraging significance determination through inclusive and collaborative approaches.","Environmental assessment ● Environmental impact assessment ● Significance ● Thresholds ● Significance

41,Research Progress and Outlook of Livestock Feeding Robot,"The production mode of livestock breeding has changed from extensive to intensive, and the production level is improved. However, low labor productivity and labor shortage have seriously restricted the rapid development of China's livestock breeding industry. As a new intelligent agricultural machinery equipment, agricultural robot integrates advanced technologies, such as intelligent monitoring, automatic control, image recognition technology, environmental modeling algorithm, sensors, flexible execution, etc. Using modern information and artificial intelligence technology, developing livestock feeding and pushing robots, realizing digital and intelligent livestock breeding, improving livestock breeding productivity are the main ways to solve the above contradiction. In order to deeply analyze the research status of robot technology in livestock breeding, products and literature were collected worldwide. This paper mainly introduced the research progress of livestock feeding robot from three aspects: Rail feeding robot, self-propelled feeding robot and pushing robot, and analyzed the technical characteristics and practical application of feeding robot.The rail feeding robot runs automatically along the fixed track, identifies the target animal, positions itself, and accurately completes feed delivery through preset programs to achieve accurate feeding of livestock. The self-propelled feeding robot can walk freely in the farm and has automatic navigation and positioning functions. The system takes single chip microcomputer as the control core and realizes automatic walking by sensor and communication module. Compared with the rail feeding robot, the feeding process is more flexible, convenient and technical, which is more conducive to the promotion and application of livestock farms. The pushing robot will automatically push the feed to the feeding area, promote the increase of feed intake of livestock, and effectively reduce the labor demand of the farm. By comparing the feeding robots of developed countries and China from two aspects of technology and application, it is found that China has achieved some innovation in technology, while developted countries do better in product application. The development of livestock robot was prospected. In terms of strategic planning, it is necessary to keep up with the international situation and the trend of technological development, and formulate the agricultural robot development strategic planning in line with China's national conditions. In terms of the development of core technologies, more attention should be paid to the integration of information perception, intelligent sensors and deep learning algorithms to realize human-computer interaction. In terms of future development trends, it is urgent to strengthen innovation, improve the friendliness and intelligence of the robot, and improve the learning ability of the robot. To sum up, intelligent livestock feeding and pushing machine operation has become a cutting-edge technology in the field of intelligent agriculture, which will surely lead to a new round of agricultural production technology reform, promote the transformation and upgrading of China's livestock industry. .","['artificial intellignce ', ' digital breeding ', ' feeding robot ', ' livestock feeding ', ' pushing robot']",1.0

47,Ecological Impact Assessment Framework for areas affected by Natural Disasters,"The forest's biodiversity consists of relations between trees, animals, the environment, and surrounding communities. Their existence required a certain balance both in number and composition. The diversity of the element itself creates a chain that connects each of the living things. Consistently, those mutual relationships are sometimes disturbed by pressures, whether man-made pressures or natural pressures. As a consequence of that event, the biodiversity loses its balance and becomes vulnerable to disaster. The fact that forest fire cases damage every living thing in the forest is becoming a massive issue in forest management. In some instances, the balance of forest biodiversity assembles an ecological resilience essential to the forest condition in combating disturbance. This paper reviews the biodiversity elements and their relationship to the extent to which elements will support ecological resilience. This is a review of 58 studies related to biodiversity balance and ecological resilience. The review discovered evidence that biodiversity components are connected and support each other. However, not every relation contributes to ecological resilience. As a result, we assess several biodiversity elements that might be useful in supporting ecological resilience, which are tree, environment, animal, and community. We also provide 2 case examples case to get the value of some biodiversity elements using a deep learning method.","['biodiversity ', ' deep learning ', ' ecological resilience ', ' forest fire ', ' forest management']",1.0

50,Questioning the EU proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act: The need for prohibitions and a stricter approach to biometric surveillance,"Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based surveillance technologies such as facial recognition, emotion recognition and other biometric technologies have been rapidly introduced by both public and private entities all around the world, raising major concerns about their impact on fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy. This article questions the efficiency of the European Commission's Proposal for Regulation of Artificial Intelligence, known as the AI Act, in addressing the threats and risks to fundamental rights posed by AI biometric surveillance systems. It argues that in order to meaningfully address risks to fundamental rights the proposed classification of these systems should be reconsidered. Although the draft AI Act acknowledges that some AI practices should be prohibited, the multiple exceptions and loopholes should be closed, and in addition new prohibitions, in particular to emotional recognition and biometric categorisation systems, should be added to counter AI surveillance practices violating fundamental rights. The AI Act should also introduce stronger legal requirements, such as third-party conformity assessment, fundamental rights impact assessment, transparency obligations as well as enhance existing EU data protection law and the rights and remedies available to individuals, thus not missing the unique opportunity to adopt the first legal framework that truly promotes trustworthy AI.","['Artificial Intelligence Act ', ' Ban on mass surveillance ', ' Biometric categorisation ', ' Emotion recognition ', ' Prohibited artificial intelligence practices ', ' Remote biometric identification']",0.0
51,Experimental assessment of high-energy high nickel-content NMC lithium-ion battery cycle life at cold temperatures,"An essential element for the diffusion and environmental impact assessment of electrochemical storage systems is their lifetime. This lifetime also impacts the overall cost of the equipment in which the storage system is used. At the same time, a number of applications, e.g. electric vehicles, do not allow a temperature control of the batteries, although the performances of the latter are very strongly linked to them. The phenomena investigated, such as aging, behavior at low temperature and rapid charge for low temperature, are complex and difficult to model. Only the establishment of databases representative of the conditions of use can lead to elements of response. The exploitation of these databases by artificial intelligence tools is certainly relevant but requires a learning on data representative of the conditions of use and of the phenomena to be evaluated. The work presented in this paper is in this context and is intended to model the influence of the rapid charge at low temperature (0 °C, −10 °C, −20 °C) on the lifetime (initial capacity loss) of lithium-Ion NMC elements. The problem with data-based approaches is the large number of tests required and the development in relevant experimental designs. Faced to this challenge, a consortium of French laboratories and manufacturers has been working together since the 2000s to carry out this type of work. The paper proposes to present a test campaign and summarizes the main results to assess the service life (loss of capacity) for a fast-charging application at low temperature and position them against the manufacturer data established at 25 °C. The impact of two partial discharge processes (50 %) will also be assessed. In a last part, we show that for low temperatures, even for the nominal charge current the life time is reduced to few dozens of cycles and a mechanical destruction of the cell with no activation of the current interrupt device is achieved. This study demonstrates and quantifies the very important impact of low-temperature charging processes on the lifetime of high energy lithium-ion NMC batteries.","['Cold temperature ', ' Cycling aging test ', ' Database ', ' Lithium-ion battery ', ' NMC']",0.0

53,Can data science achieve the ideal of evidence-based decision-making in environmental regulation?,"Data science, including big data analytics and machine-learning techniques, is increasingly utilized in environmental governance. This study explores the perspectives of environmental experts on the limitations of data science in evidence-based environmental regulations. Based on semi-structured interviews with 20 environmental experts, this study examines three key limitations: the lack of local specificity in big data, the uncertainty of the environment as an open system, and the opacity of machine learning. The main findings of the study are as follows: First, the lack of spatial and temporal specificity in big data poses challenges in using them as regulatory evidence, requiring revalidation through traditional assessment methods. Second, while machine learning performs well in closed virtual environments, it is susceptible to the fluid and uncertain nature of the environment in an open world. Third, the lack of causal explanation owing to the inscrutability of deep learning limits its utility for regulatory evidence. The study concludes that while the applicability of data science to evidence-based decision-making in environmental regulation is limited, it can still be utilized in data-driven environmental governance without the need for region-specific information or a high burden of decision-making responsibility. This includes tasks such as strategic environmental impact assessments, policy resource allocation, or environmental policy prioritization.","['Artificial intelligence ', ' Big data ', ' Data science ', ' Environmental regulation ', ' Evidence-based policy']",1.0

56,"The application of life cycle assessment in buildings: challenges, and directions for future research","Purpose: This paper reviews the state-of-the art research in life cycle assessment (LCA) applied to buildings. It focuses on current research trends, and elaborates on gaps and directions for future research. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify current research and applications of LCA in buildings. The proposed review methodology includes (i) identifying recent authoritative research publications using established search engines, (ii) screening and retaining relevant publications, and (iii) extracting relevant LCA applications for buildings and analyzing their underpinning research. Subsequently, several research gaps and limitations were identified, which have informed our proposed future research directions. Results and discussions: This paper argues that humans can attenuate and positively control the impact of their buildings on the environment, and as such mitigate the effects of climate change. This can be achieved by a new generation of LCA methods and tools that are model based and continuously learn from real-time data, while informing effective operation and management strategies of buildings and districts. Therefore, the consideration of the time dimension in product system modeling is becoming essential to understand the resulting pollutant emissions and resource consumption. This time dimension is currently missing in life cycle inventory databases. A further combination of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models using time-dependent characterization factors can lead to more comprehensive and reliable LCA results. Conclusions and recommendations: This paper promotes the concept of semantic-based dynamic (real-time) LCA, which addresses temporal and spatial variations in the local built and environmental ecosystem, and thus more effectively promotes a “cradle-to-grave-to-reincarnation” environmental sustainability capability. Furthermore, it is critical to leverage digital building resources (e.g., connected objects, semantic models, and artificial intelligence) to deliver accurate and reliable environmental assessments.","['Building information modeling (BIM) ', ' Dynamic data ', ' Life cycle assessment (LCA) ', ' Machine learning (ML) ', ' Semantic models']",1.0

58,Analysis of the supporting tools of population entrepreneurial initiatives,"An analysis of existing support tools in the field of entrepreneurship population initiatives in the Russian Federation is necessary in order to update the areas of population employment. It is very important to develop population entrepreneurial initiatives for the modern economy, ensuring the responsible attitude of entrepreneurs to the environment and sustainable development of the whole country, which is very important in a pandemic. It should be noted that entrepreneurship is considered to be one of the main factors of socio-economic development and a key condition for achieving the competitiveness of the country's economy. New areas and activities contributes to the rising demand for new professions and specialties. Not only at the state level but also in the global market does the concept of economic development provide an opportunity for a socio-economic breakthrough in the field of employment diversification, focused on the introduction of new directions. However, authors noted that the impact assessment of the fourth industrial revolution and the digital economy causes heated discussions among leading experts in this field. A number of scientists determine this influence as a certain regularity of the next stage of the process of technological development.

59,Understanding the Functionality of Probiotics on the Edge of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Era,"This review focuses on the potential utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) tools to deepen our understanding of probiotics, their mode of action, and technological characteristics such as survival. To that end, this review provides an overview of the current knowledge on probiotics as well as next-generation probiotics. AI-aided omics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, offer new insights into the genetic and functional properties of probiotics. Furthermore, AI can be used to elucidate key probiotic activities such as microbiota modulation, metabolite production, and immune system interactions to enable an improved understanding of their health impacts. Additionally, AI technologies facilitate precision in identifying probiotic health impacts, including their role in gut health, anticancer activity, and antiaging effects. Beyond health applications, AI can expand the technological use of probiotics, optimizing storage survival and broadening biotechnological approaches. In this context, this review addresses how AI-driven approaches can be facilitated by strengthening the evaluation of probiotic characteristics, explaining their mechanisms of action, and enhancing their technological applications. Moreover, the potential of AI to enhance the precision of probiotic health impact assessments and optimize industrial applications is highlighted, concluding with future perspectives on the transformative role of AI in probiotic research.","['AI-driven probiotic research ', ' biotechnological optimization ', ' metabolite production ', ' microbiota modulation ', ' omics technologies ', ' precision health ', ' viability']",0.0
60,Responsible Artificial Intelligence in Government: Development of a Legal Framework for South Africa,"Various international guideline documents suggest a human-centric approach to the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) in society, to ensure that AI products are developed and used with due respect to ethical principles and human rights. Key principles contained in these international documents are: transparency (explainability), accountability, fairness and privacy. Some governments are using AI in the delivery of public services, but there is a lack of appropriate policy and legal frameworks to ensure responsible AI in government. This paper reviews recent international developments and concludes that, an appropriate policy and legal framework must be based on the key principles contextualised to the world of AI. A national legal framework alone is not sufficient and should be accompanied by a practical instrument, such as an algorithm impact assessment, aimed at reducing risk or harm. Recommendations for a possible South African legal framework for responsible AI in government are proposed.","['algorithm ', ' Artificial intelligence ', ' automated decision-making ', ' legal framework ', ' responsible AI']",0.0
61,AI Ethics Impact Assessment based on Requirement Engineering,"This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating the ethical impact of artificial intelligence (AI) systems on people and society based on AI ethics guidelines. The ethical impact of AI has been recognized as a social issue, and countries and organizations have formulated principles and guidelines on AI ethics, and laws and regulations will be enforced in Europe. Because these principles and guidelines are written in terms of philosophy and law, AI service providers, developers, and business users have the challenge of how they should practice the principles and guidelines to their AI systems. To address this challenge, we first analyzed cases of ethical problems caused by AI in the past and assumed that ethical problems could be linked to interactions between components of AI systems and stakeholders related to such systems. On the basis of this assumption, we then developed a methodology to comprehensively extract the ethical risks that an AI system poses. This methodology consists of two approaches. The first approach is to develop an AI ethics model that embodies ethics guidelines as necessary requirements for ethical AI systems and correlates these requirements with interactions. The second approach is an impact assessment process that uses the AI ethics models to extract ethical risks for individual AI systems. In this paper, we discuss the details of this methodology and show the results of an initial validation to verify the above assumption and the ease of the impact assessment process.","['AI ethics ', ' AI governance ', ' impact assessment ', ' responsible AI ', ' risk-based approach']",0.0
62,Strategizing Low Carbon Urban Planning Through Environmental Impact Assessment by Artificial Intelligence Driven Carbon Footprint Forecasting,"Addressing the associated rise in Carbon Emissions (CE) as smart cities expand becomes paramount. Effective low-carbon urban planning demands robust, precise assessments. This research introduces a cutting-edge solution via an Artificial Intelligence (AI) -driven Carbon Footprint (CF) impact assessment. A detailed dataset, collected over 3 years, was harnessed to gather insights into vital urban factors, including CE, Energy Consumption (EC) patterns, variations in land use, transportation dynamics, and changes in air quality. The cornerstone of this research is developing the Multi-modal Stacked VAR-LSTM model. This model proposes to provide accurate CF predictions for urban environments by merging the capabilities of Vector Autoregression (VAR) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. The process encompasses dedicated assessments for each data segment, harnessing VAR to delineate interdependencies and refining these predictions with the LSTM network using the residuals from the VAR analysis. By interweaving AI-driven carbon footprint impact assessments into the urban planning discourse, this study underscores the vast potential in sculpting future urban development strategies that are sustainable and sensitive to carbon impact.","['Carbon Emissions ', ' Low-Carbon Urban Planning ', ' LSTM ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Vector Autoregression']",1.0
63,The Future of Green Building Research - A Cascade Approach of Bibliometric Analysis and Topic Modelling,"Green building research has received a lot of attention from both academicians and practitioners. Even though, this has resulted in a surge in Green Building literature in the recent times, the review of the literature has either being too focused on specific aspects or too broad. This study attempts to address this issue by employing a combination of bibliometric analysis and topic modelling. The inclusion of a stringent quality filter and use of CorEx topic modelling has enabled us to generate a list of future research directions, which were further streamlined through manual intervention. The study has revealed a few very promising few research directions including the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Green Building, Building Information System (BIM) for Green Building, development of sustainable materials and construction methods, socio-economic impact assessment of Green Buildings and incorporation of Internal Environmental Quality principles into built environment. The findings of the study are an integration of recommendations by many impactful studies in the Green Building literature and have tried to be a true testament to the idea that 'the whole is greater than the sum of its parts'.",,1.0
64,The future of green skills for the manufacturing sector,"The European Green Deal and the European Innovation Council (EIC) aim to drive sustainability in manufacturing. Industry 5.0 emphasises the integration of automation with green skills, highlighting their importance for sustainability. However, which manufacturing areas need green skills and which green skills are crucial in manufacturing remains unclear. This paper aims to fill these gaps, by performing a literature review and an analysis of the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations (ESCO) database. Results identify five critical areas: Product-Process Design, Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence, Supply Chain Management, Circular Economy, and Energy Management. These areas necessitate skills such as environmental impact assessment, waste management, data analysis, eco-design, and knowledge of renewable energy technologies. ESCO analysis indicates that 46.28% of 3008 occupations involve green skills, which are crucial for sustainable development. Targeted training programs are needed based on identified areas and skills. Interconnections among clusters and the importance of data analysis are highlighted. Additionally, in the near future manufacturing companies should attempt to develop broad, transversal skills integrated with digitalisation to meet an increasing demand for sustainability. Overall, the study provides insights into green skills development and their critical role in shaping the future of sustainable manufacturing.","['green skills ', ' manufacturing ', ' sustainability']",0.0
65,"Anthropogenic black carbon as short-lived climate pollutants: Critical advancements in global-regional monitoring, characterization, emission inventory, and impact analysis","Black carbon (BC) is a major short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP) with significant climate and environmental-health impacts. This review synthesizes critical advancements in the identification of emerging anthropogenic BC sources, updates to global warming potential (GWP) and global temperature potential (GTP) metrics, technical progress in characterization techniques, improvements in global-regional monitoring networks, emission inventory, and impact assessment methods. Notably, gas flaring, shipping, and urban waste burning have slowly emerged as dominant emission sources, especially in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Arctic regions. The updated GWP over 100 years for BC is estimated at 342 CO<inf>2</inf>-eq, compared to 658 CO<inf>2</inf>-eq in IPCC AR5. Recent CMIP6-based Earth System Models (ESMs) have improved attribution of BC's microphysics, identifying a 22 % increase in radiative forcing (RF) over hotspots like East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Despite progress, challenges persist in monitoring network inter-comparability, emission inventory uncertainty, and underrepresentation of BC processes in ESMs. Future efforts could benefit from the integration of satellite data, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted methods, and harmonized protocols to improve BC assessment. Targeted mitigation strategies could avert up to four million premature deaths globally by 2030, albeit at a 17 % additional cost. These findings highlight BC's pivotal roles in near-term climate and sustainability policy.","['Artificial intelligence ', ' Black carbon ', ' Earth system models ', ' Emission inventory ', ' Global warming potential ', ' Radiative forcing ', ' Short-lived climate pollutant']",1.0
66,Exploring the effects of climate change and urban policies on lake water quality using remote sensing and explainable artificial intelligence,"Climate change and urban policies significantly impact lake water quality, especially in rapidly developing regions. Existing impact assessments are limited by the duration and resolution of water quality data, while long-term impacts and contributions of climate and socioeconomic drivers have rarely been quantified. In this study, we utilized remote sensing imagery to obtain high spatiotemporal resolution data and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to reveal how the comprehensive impacts vary over time. We obtained Trophic State Index (TSI) data between 2000 and 2022 from remote sensing imagery. XAI was employed to elucidate the intricate connections between TSI and the multifaceted factors that encompass climate and socioeconomic dynamics. Six typical lakes in East China were selected for this study. Results showed that the TSI of these lakes had generally decreased over the past two decades, being typically higher in the littoral zones compared to the center. Moreover, higher temperatures increased lake TSI. Meanwhile, higher rainfall increased TSI through increased lake nutrient inputs from surrounding watersheds where agricultural and industrial activities are intensive. It was also found that economic development impacts on lake TSI shifted around 2013. Economic development caused severe negative effects on lake water quality before 2013, while this phenomenon decreased thereafter. This is attributed to the implementation of a series of green transformation policies in the region. This study demonstrates the long-term contribution of climate change and urban policies in driving lake water quality variations, and provides implications for policy makers to establish positive economic, social, and environmental linkages.","['Development policy ', ' Interpretable machine learning ', ' Satellite image ', ' Urban lake ', ' Water quality model ', ' XAI']",1.0

Millions of people are dying prematurely each year as a direct cause of poor air quality. According to recent studies, living within 50 meters of any significant road can increase the risk of lung cancer by up to 10%. World Health Organization declares that approximately 3.7 million people died worldwide in 2012 due to outdoor air pollution. In this analysis, we analyzed air pollutants that were released into the air from a wide range of sources, such as motor vehicles, industrial combustion processes, etc. We analyzed the Sentinel-5 precursor data, which provides time series data on a multitude of trace gaseous compounds such as CO, NO2, SO2, O3, PM10, PM2.5 aerosols, etc. with efficient statistics and special resolution. For better comparison, we have trained our statistical atmospheric data with deep learning methodology and analyzed them to obtain a reference for air quality in India.

68,The Digital Agricultural Knowledge and Information System (DAKIS): Employing digitalisation to encourage diversified and multifunctional agricultural systems,"Multifunctional and diversified agriculture can address diverging pressures and demands by simultaneously enhancing productivity, biodiversity, and the provision of ecosystem services. The use of digital technologies can support this by designing and managing resource-efficient and context-specific agricultural systems. We present the Digital Agricultural Knowledge and Information System (DAKIS) to demonstrate an approach that employs digital technologies to enable decision-making towards diversified and sustainable agriculture. To develop the DAKIS, we specified, together with stakeholders, requirements for a knowledge-based decision-support tool and reviewed the literature to identify limitations in the current generation of tools. The results of the review point towards recurring challenges regarding the consideration of ecosystem services and biodiversity, the capacity to foster communication and cooperation between farmers and other actors, and the ability to link multiple spatiotemporal scales and sustainability levels. To overcome these challenges, the DAKIS provides a digital platform to support farmers' decision-making on land use and management via an integrative spatiotemporally explicit approach that analyses a wide range of data from various sources. The approach integrates remote and in situ sensors, artificial intelligence, modelling, stakeholder-stated demand for biodiversity and ecosystem services, and participatory sustainability impact assessment to address the diverse drivers affecting agricultural land use and management design, including natural and agronomic factors, economic and policy considerations, and socio-cultural preferences and settings. Ultimately, the DAKIS embeds the consideration of ecosystem services, biodiversity, and sustainability into farmers' decision-making and enables learning and progress towards site-adapted small-scale multifunctional and diversified agriculture while simultaneously supporting farmers' objectives and societal demands.","['Biodiversity ', ' Decision support system ', ' Digital agriculture ', ' Ecosystem services ', ' Farming practices ', ' Modelling ', ' Small-scale management']",1.0
69,"Fusion of Smart Meteorological Sensors, Remote Sensing Techniques, and IoT in Context of Industry 4.0","In general, the Internet of Things (IoT) concept allows any type of electrical equipment to connect the Internet (thing). As both an outcome, any “thing” will be assigned an Internet Protocol (IP) identifier and will be reachable using normal Web protocols such as Domain Name System (DNS). The IoT will be a technology or functionality associated with conventional ISA-95 automation systems in an automated environment. IoT automation elements include sensor, actuators, Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), control loops, data analytics, control models, simulators, and optimizers. The IoT, Industry 4.0, and intelligent systems might all be combined to produce a strong mixture that foreshadows an amazing future with enhanced efficiency. In many areas, especially the industrial sector, long-term growth is crucial. With the help of an intelligent system, we may be able to detect and address significant issues in Industry 4.0. As a consequence, the concept may be thought of as a physical device or a feature computed in a software system that runs on any device with sufficient computing power. An IoT device presently lacks a standardized technology. Several projects to standardize are now in the works. For example, the International Telecommunication Union has a standardization working group SG20 on “IoT and its applications, including smart cities and communities,” and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has an ongoing IoT Ecosystem study as well as the IEEE P2413 draught standard for an architectural framework for the IoT. This chapter provides a review of the literature on revolutionary industrial growth and the difficulties and advantages of Industry 4.0. One of the most pressing issues in the current scenario is achieving long-term growth. Air quality has become a major problem on a global scale. This chapter also includes a case study on the merging of meteorological sensors with remote sensing devices. This case study demonstrates the relationship between meteorological sensors, such as temperature, wind, and relative humidity, and Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) as well as its importance in regional air quality monitoring.

70,A systematic review of artificial intelligence impact assessments,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is producing highly beneficial impacts in many domains, from transport to healthcare, from energy distribution to marketing, but it also raises concerns about undesirable ethical and social consequences. AI impact assessments (AI-IAs) are a way of identifying positive and negative impacts early on to safeguard AI’s benefits and avoid its downsides. This article describes the first systematic review of these AI-IAs. Working with a population of 181 documents, the authors identified 38 actual AI-IAs and subjected them to a rigorous qualitative analysis with regard to their purpose, scope, organisational context, expected issues, timeframe, process and methods, transparency and challenges. The review demonstrates some convergence between AI-IAs. It also shows that the field is not yet at the point of full agreement on content, structure and implementation. The article suggests that AI-IAs are best understood as means to stimulate reflection and discussion concerning the social and ethical consequences of AI ecosystems. Based on the analysis of existing AI-IAs, the authors describe a baseline process of implementing AI-IAs that can be implemented by AI developers and vendors and that can be used as a critical yardstick by regulators and external observers to evaluate organisations’ approaches to AI.","['AI ', ' AI governance ', ' Impact assessment ', ' Systematic review']",0.0

Additional alerts concerning the procedural ineffectiveness of the strategic environmental assessment (SEA) process from the cost-benefit point of view are advanced. The major contribution to the long lasting, costly SEA processes, comes from ultraistic treatment of Natura 2000.The case study deals with a plan for constructing a traffic bypass around Škofljica, a town near Ljubljana. Based on their conclusions the authors propose that the following elements of the SEA procedure should be improved and optimised:. -CBA for SEA should become a regular component when measuring its effectiveness.-Concretisation of expected SEA inputs to the plan should clarify its role at the earliest stage of the process.-SEA should contribute interactively to the optimisation of alternatives; cost-benefit analysis of the SEA process could support this process.-Nature protection interest should be confronted and balanced with wider development interests as formulated in the plan and should not be applied in absolute terms (e.g. Natura 2000). © 2014 Elsevier Inc.", CBA; Optimisation; Planning process; SEA,1.0
73,"Environmental agreements, EIA follow-up and aboriginal participation in environmental management: The Canadian experience","During the last decade a number of environmental agreements (EAs) have been negotiated in Canada involving industry, government and Aboriginal peoples. This article draws on the Canadian experience to consider the potential of such negotiated agreements to address two issues widely recognised in academic and policy debates on environmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental management. The first relates to the need to secure indigenous participation in environmental management of major projects that affect indigenous peoples. The second and broader issue involves the necessity for specific initiatives to ensure effective follow-up of EIA. The Canadian experience indicates that negotiated environmental agreements have considerable potential to address both issues. However, if this potential is to be realized, greater effort must be made to develop structures and processes specifically designed to encourage Aboriginal participation; and EAs must themselves provide the financial and other resource required to support EIA follow-up and Aboriginal participation. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

74,Development of an environmental impact assessment evaluation model and its application: Taiwan case study,"This article describes an environmental impact assessment (EIA) evaluation model that can be used to assess the completeness and effectiveness of EIA systems. This model is based on a consideration of the fundamental components of an EIA. The EIA system in Taiwan has been used as the case study to demonstrate how the proposed EIA evaluation model can be applied. Taiwan is demonstrated to have a comprehensive EIA system, which is clearly defined legally and with guidelines available to assist proponents in implementing the system. A particular strength is the requirement for compliance and enforcement monitoring. Important reservations are the lack of an appeals system and the failure to require the consideration of no-action or alternative-action strategies and the lack of public participation at some key points in the EIA process, particularly at the decision-making stage. Training programs could be more comprehensively available to expand national EIA capability. It is concluded that the proposed EIA evaluation model provides a useful tool for the evaluation of EIA systems. National authorities can apply this model to analyze strengths and weaknesses of their EIA systems.", ,1.0

Although the best enforcement system would depend on the local social, political, and legal systems, five universally desirable features are identified. First, a comprehensive coordinated monitoring and reassessment system is needed. Second, the agencies concerned must have adequate resources to do the work and incentives to carry it out well. Third, there must be the necessary legal powers. Fourth, provision must be made for changing the conditions based on experience.

77,Exergoenvironmental analysis of the integrated copper-chlorine cycle for hydrogen production,"Thermochemical water-splitting cycles have the potential of producing large-scale and cost-effective sustainable hydrogen in an environmentally benign manner. Limited exergoenvironmental assessments have been reported in the literature which generally considers thermochemical hydrogen production and specifically the copper-chlorine (Cu–Cl) cycle in thid regard. Thus, the present investigation aims at assessing the four-step integrated Cu–Cl thermochemical cycle set-up located at the Ontario Tech University thereby contributing to the environmental impact assessment of thermochemical hydrogen production. In this study, the exergy analysis of the cycle is first performed by thermodynamically modeling and simulating the cycle in Aspen-plus. The fundamental principles of the exergoenvironmental analysis, analogous to the specific exergy costing (SPECO) methodology of the exergoeconomic evaluation, are applied to the cycle and the balanced environmental impact equations for all cycle components are developed. Based on the balanced environmental impact equations, the environmental impact rate, and the specific environmental impact at each state point is evaluated. The environmental impact levels for all the major cycle components are also obtained. The exergoenvironmental factor, the relative difference of the specific environmental impacts, and the environmental impact rate of exergy destruction for various cycle components are in this regard evaluated. Furthermore, the influence of various parameters on the cumulative and component-related rate of environmental impact as well as the exergoenvironmental factor is analyzed by conducting a detailed sensitivity analysis. According to the obtained results, the rate of environmental impact corresponding to exergy destruction dominates the component-related rate of environmental impact and thus the potential reduction in the cumulative environmental impact for various components could be achieved by improving their exergy efficiencies. The hydrolysis step accounts for 60% of the component-related environmental impact while the thermolysis step accounts for the highest environmental impact of exergy destruction ranging between 41 and 42%. The percentage difference between fossil fuel-based and renewable electricity in terms of the global warming potential ranges between 80% and 98% with the highest difference for wind and nuclear-based electricity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd", Cu–Cl cycle; Environment; Exergoenvironmental analysis; Exergy; Hydrogen; Sustainability,0.0
78,Multiple criteria data envelopment analysis for full ranking units associated to environment impact assessment,"The importance of the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of large development projects is increasingly underlined. Usually, EIA involves a lot of qualitative and quantitative criteria. Data envelopment analysis (DEA), an effective method that is used to rank and select the best alternative from a set of alternatives, is not tailored to address qualitative criteria, thus rendering the application to multiple criteria problems not amenable. This paper presents a new methodology of multiple criteria data envelopment analysis (MCDEA), which can address both qualitative and quantitative criteria. MCDEA is divided into two stages for fully ranking units and each unit has multiple inputs and outputs. In the first stage, a qualitative method is applied to compare the qualitative performance of alternatives. Then, MCDEA is used to rank the alternatives by considering the relative membership degree of qualitative factors as one of the quantitative data. A case study on the selection of dam location illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

79,An evaluation of the environmental impact assessment system in Vietnam: The gap between theory and practice,"Vietnam has one of the fastest growing economies in the world and has achieved significant socio-economic development in recent years. However this growth is placing increased pressure on an already depleted natural environment. Environmental impact assessment (EIA) is recognised by the Government and international organizations as an important tool in the management of the impacts of future development on the country's natural resource base. The Government's commitment to EIA has been demonstrated through the development and adoption of the Law on Environment Protection (Revised) in 2005 which sets out the requirements for EIA and which represents a major step in the development of a robust legislative framework for EIA in Vietnam. The Law on Environment Protection (Revised) 2005 has now been operational for several years and we have undertaken an evaluation of the resulting EIA system in Vietnam. We argue that while significant improvements have been achieved in the EIA policy framework, an important gap remains between EIA theory and practice. We contend that the basis of the current EIA legislation is strong and that future developments of the EIA system in Vietnam should focus on improving capacity of EIA practitioners rather than further substantial legislative change. Such improvements would allow the Vietnamese EIA system to emerge as an effective and efficient tool for environmental management in Vietnam and as a model EIA framework for other developing countries. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.", Developing countries; Environmental impact assessment; Vietnam,1.0

Public participation in EIA is commonly deemed to foster democratic policy-making and to render EIA more effective. Yet a closer look at the literature unveils that, beyond this general assertion, opinions of the precise meaning, objectives and adequate representation of public participation in EIA considerably diverge. Against this background, in this article we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the academic debate on public participation in EIA concerning its meaning, objectives and adequate level of inclusiveness. In so doing, we hope to stimulate a more focused debate on the subject, which is key to advancing the research agenda. Furthermore, this paper may serve as a starting point for practitioners involved in defining the role of public participation in EIA practice. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.", Democracy; Effectiveness; EIA; Legitimacy; Public participation,1.0
81,Evaluating the effectiveness of a national environmental and social impact assessment system: lessons from Uganda,"We consider the adequacy of the legislative and administrative provisions for environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) in Uganda. Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) legislation was enacted in Uganda in 1995. Although it was intended that social impacts would also be considered, the nomenclature, organizational culture and practice of EIA has given an over-emphasis to biophysical issues, with social issues being under considered. Lack of explicit instructions about how to assess social impacts and the positioning of ESIA too late in the project cycle limit the ability of social issues to be properly considered. From document analysis, an on-line survey, in-depth interviews, reflexive practice, and a literature review, we found that there was inadequate public participation, poor follow-up, low levels of capacity in all stakeholders, and political interference in the project approval process. To improve the effectiveness of ESIA in Uganda and other developing countries, we make recommendations to address the challenges facing ESIA practice. © 2021 The Author(s).

82,A Machine Learning-Based Ecological Impact Assessment Model for Tourism Destinations,"Conservation efforts may find tourism either helpful or harmful. Protected environments felt the environmental toll of tourism's growth and variety. A framework for environmentally responsible tourism was proposed based on real-world studies that examined the connection between growth in tourism and environmental compatibility. Global interest in the Ecological Impact Assessment (EIA) of tourist attraction issues has grown as environmental preservation has gained more and more attention. The paradigm proposed a moderating role for government support and policy interventions in preserving an ecological system while striking a balance between corporate and ecological concerns. The research population includes all parties involved in tourism, such as travelers, local government officials, hotel owners, and tour operators that operate in the region. This study aims to develop an integrated decision-making method for environmental impact assessments of tourist attractions. A model for predicting the demand for cruise tourism called IRBFNN-GSA, which is an improved radial basis function neural network with a gravitational search algorithm, and a model for predicting the effect of tourism on changes in the density of vegetation on land, called Support Vector Machine (SVM), are both suggested to improve the effectiveness of forecasts. An improved radial basis function neural networks model's hyper-parameters are fine-tuned using GSA in the suggested variant. The results show that IRBFNN-GSA has the best predicting performance when used with certain mobile keywords and economic indices when compared with other models with different parameters. The findings show that SVMs are useful predictors for tourist demand forecasting and that the methodology's recommended framework is successful.  © 2025 The Author(s).", Ecological impact assessment; hyper-parameters; integrated decision-making; support vector machine,0.0
83,Habitat preferences and causes of population decline for Barn Owls Tyto alba: A multi-scale approach,"Aims: Habitat preferences of Barn Owls was studied in two areas of Spain undergoing large-scale habitat alteration. Location: Alicante (dry cultivations) and Valencia (irrigated cultivations) in eastern Spain. Methods: Habitat composition around occupied and unoccupied territories in dry cultures and irrigated cultures was compared (n = 71, 1989-2000). This study also described differences in habitat composition between occupied and deserted territories after major habitat alterations started in 1996. Generalized Linear Models were used to examine patterns of habitat preference at three different spatial scales: nest site, home range and landscape. Results: The study population declined by 69% in both study areas. At the nest site scale, Barn Owls preferred undisturbed areas with high availability of cavities, mainly in man-made structures. At the home range and landscape scales, Barn Owls occupied undisturbed areas with a high availability of cavities and high percentages of edges and ditches. Territory desertion was prompted by the modernisation or disappearance of man-made structures, depletion of edges and ditches, expansion of the road network and persecution. Accordingly, the spatial distribution of territories in irrigated cultures changed from uniform to random after habitat alteration. The availability of cavities alone does not account for all of the explained deviance, i.e., Barn Owls occupy structurally complex landscapes. Conclusions: Compensation measures for habitat loss such as nest-box programs, usually proposed within the framework of environmental impact assessment, are discouraged unless habitat restoration and effective control of persecution are promoted first.", Agriculture abandonment; Barn Owl; Environmental impact assessment; Nest-boxes; Persecution; Strategic environmental assessment; Tyto alba,1.0
84,Life cycle assessment of atmospheric emission profiles of the Italian geothermal power plants,"After nearly a decade of only small development in capacity in deep geothermal sector in Europe, in recent years a resurgence of interest in geothermal power and the use of innovative technologies to increase and better exploit geo-thermoelectric generation has stolen the limelight from the scientific community. Differently from other types of energy sources, the environmental impacts determined by geothermal exploitation are extremely dependent on the geographical location. Life Cycle Assessment offers a powerful methodological approach for the investigation of the environmental footprint of power generation systems. Focusing on an unprecedented system-modelling approach for the investigation of an environmental impacts analysis of geo-thermoelectric activity in the Tuscany Region, Italy, in this work we perform a comprehensive environmental impact assessment for the calculation of atmospheric emissions profiles connected with the operational phase of the power plants. A clustering of all the geothermal installations in operation nowadays is performed by considering geographical representativeness This allows the identification of regional geothermal subareas. Moreover, an extensive data processing analysis is implemented with the aim of reconciling the great variability found among data collected. Results demonstrate that the efforts undertaken by the operator of the geothermal power plants to limit the impact of emissions, through abatement systems like AMIS, are quite effective. Indeed, in areas where mercury and ammonia concentration in fluids constitute a problem to deal with, nowadays the emissive patterns result comparable to the other ones. Notwithstanding, mercury and ammonia emissions, mainly emitted through the cooling towers, still represent a critical problem for all the geothermal fields. On the basis of our findings we conclude that potential chemical interactions and environmental impacts related to the variety of the compounds emitted should be object of future research and a further effort to minimize them. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd", AMIS abatement system; Atmospheric emissions; Geo-thermoelectric power plants; Geothermal energy; Life cycle assessment; Uncertainty analysis,1.0
85,Greece's reformed EIA system: Evaluating its implementation and potential,"The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the Greek government and the troika in 2010 contained numerous austerity policies and requirements for administrative reforms, among which is that of the national Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) system. Complying with this requirement, Law4014/2011 was passed, aiming at reducing bureaucracy and increasing the country's appeal to investors whilst ensuring environmental protection. The present paper provides the first systematic, multi-scale and multidimensional evaluation of the effectiveness of the new EIA system. The evaluation is based firstly on the results of a Pan-Hellenic survey, involving key EIA consultants and authorities; secondly, on additional, in-depth interviews with EIA specialists, National- Ministry and Regional EIA Authorities; and thirdly, on the content review of 105 Environmental Impact statements. The results highlight the persistence of serious problems despite the reform of the Hellenic EIA System. The data reveal a significant discrepancy between what is set out in law and the actual practice. Although Law 4014/2011 contains progressive and innovative elements (such as adopting a life cycle approach to the EIA process, and mandating the development and use of a central Electronic Environmental Registry (e-ER) to manage and publish results of the EIA process), the recorded failure to implement them in practice results in a non-transparent and ineffective EIA system. Recommendations for improvement are proposed as well as areas for further research. © 2018", E-environmental registry; EIA system effectiveness; Environmental information; Greek EIA system,1.0
86,Evaluation and optimization of a circular economy model integrating planting and breeding based on the coupling of emergy analysis and life cycle assessment,"The sustainable development of agriculture is facing problems such as high resource consumption and serious environmental pollution. The development of the circular economy model integrating planting and breeding (CEMIPB) has become an effective way to realize the sustainable development of agriculture. Due to the great difference of natural resource attributes in different regions of China, CEMIPB shows diverse characteristics on the whole. Based on this, this paper constructs a coupling model based on emergy analysis (EMA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) called EM-LCA model and conducts an empirical analysis using a typical CEMIPB in Fujian Province, China, as a case. By comparing the results of the EM-LCA and EMA models, the former effectively compensates for the deficiencies of the latter in terms of economic and environmental impact assessment, and the evaluation results can better reflect the actual situation of the system. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis is introduced to identify key processes and substances. Based on the reduce–reuse–recycle (3R) principle, several optimization suggestions, such as reducing the input of corn and veterinary drugs, are put forward. The construction of the aforementioned methodology system can provide a new perspective for research in similar fields and provide a scientific basis for local government decision making. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.", EM-LCA model; Model evaluation; Optimization suggestions; Planting and breeding integration; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development,0.0
87,Environmental impact assessment (EIA) effectiveness in protected areas,"Despite increased focus on environmental impact assessment (EIA) effectiveness in general, little research has been conducted on EIA effectiveness in protected areas (PAs). This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of EIA in PAs through the use of 42 specifically designed key performance indicators (KPIs) derived from a theory of change (ToC) approach to effectiveness evaluation. These KPIs are applied to a selection of six EIA cases from a specific case country, namely South Africa. In so doing, this research evaluates EIA effectiveness against three dimensions, namely, transactive, procedural and substantive effectiveness, whilst also identifying four causal scenarios for EIA effectiveness in PAs. The research found that costs, skills and competencies, as well as EIA report substance, were particular weaknesses for the cases evaluated. However, these weaknesses did not always produce a causal link to the effectiveness of the EIAs. © 2021 IAIA.", causality; effectiveness; EIA; procedural; protected areas; substantive; transactive,1.0
88,Evaluation of the effectiveness of environmental impact assessment in East Africa: The case of Rwanda,"EIA is an important regulatory tool which can play a key role in achieving of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and it is defined as a tool used to predict the likely impact of a project or development on the environment. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in Rwanda. Data were collected using a descriptive survey design. A structured questionnaire was developed, pretested and administered to a sample of 110 respondents using purposive sampling technique. Of the 110 questionnaires administered 82 were retrieved and analyzed into frequencies and simple percentages using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) and Microsoft Excel 2016 version. The study showed that 1188 EIA clearances were issued between 2011 and 2019 while 3085 EIA certificates were issued between 2006 and 2019. The survey revealed that EIA experts in Rwanda largely gain experience from the construction, water and sanitation, and agriculture sectors. Though the legislation covering EIA in Rwanda is very strong, the study showed that the only way to improve the effectiveness of EIA is to strengthen the quality of documentation and to offer electronic services as well as incorporating EIA results into decision-making mechanisms. The study also identified insufficient monitoring of environmental management plans (45% of respondents), poor follow-ups (30%), inexperienced practitioners in EIA implementation and auditing (30%), lack of professionalism by EIA practitioners (30%), and poor public participation (25%). This could potentially hinder EIA effectiveness. The study therefore recommends that quality documentation and electronic services as well as follow-up to review projects be enforced to improve EIA effectiveness. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.", conservation; effectiveness; Environmental impact assessment; legislative; restoration,1.0
89,Framing effectiveness in impact assessment: Discourse accommodation in controversial infrastructure development,"There is ongoing debate about the effectiveness of impact assessment tools, which matters both because of the threat to future practice of the tools which are frequently perceived to be ineffective, and because of the disillusionment that can ensue, and controversy generated, amongst stakeholders in a decision context where opportunities for meaningful debate have not been provided. In this article we regard debate about the meaning of effectiveness in impact assessment as an inevitable consequence of increased participation in environmental decision-making, and therefore frame effectiveness based on an inclusive democracy role to mean the extent to which impact assessment can accommodate civil society discourse. Our aim is to investigate effectiveness based on this framing by looking at one type of impact assessment - environmental impact assessment (EIA) - in two controversial project proposals: the HS2 rail network in England; and the A4DS motorway in the Netherlands. Documentary analysis and interviews held with key civil society stakeholders have been deployed to identify discourses that were mobilised in the cases. EIA was found to be able to accommodate only one out of four discourses that were identified; for the other three it did not provide the space for the arguments that characterised opposition. The conclusion in relation to debate on framings of effectiveness is that EIA will not be considered effective by the majority of stakeholders. EIA was established to support decision-making through a better understanding of impacts, so its ineffectiveness is unsurprising when its role is perceived to be broader. However, there remains a need to map discourses in different decision contexts and to analyse the extent to which the range of discourses are accommodated throughout the decision process, and the role of impact assessment in those processes, before recommendations can be made to either improve impact assessment effectiveness, or whether it is simply perceptions of effectiveness that need to be improved. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.", A4DS; Discourse accommodation; Effectiveness; Environmental impact assessment; HS2; Infrastructure development,1.0
90,"Revealing EIA process-related barriers in transport projects: The cases of Italy, Portugal, and Spain","The effectiveness of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in the transport field is increasingly being contested. Apart from technical issues (e.g., impacts measurements), the literature highlights process-related barriers as key obstacles to effective EIA implementation in transport projects (e.g., lack of collaborative work, transparency, etc.). Nevertheless, most academic efforts to date have focused on technical improvements, paying limited attention to the relevance of process-related barriers. To address this shortcoming, the paper aims to explore and compare how EIA is experienced and perceived by professionals in three South-European countries (Italy, Portugal, and Spain), providing additional insights into EIA process-related barriers in transport projects. The findings were obtained through an online survey of 294 professionals, representing two main stakeholder groups: environmental consultants and transport planners. The results reveal four main types of process problems shared in all three countries: (i) EIA timing, (ii) assessment of alternatives, (iii) monitoring system, and (iv) public participation. The highest divergences are seen in Spain, where 42% of identified process-related barriers are shared with the rest of countries, while Italian and Portuguese respondents agree in the perception of 68% of process-related barriers. The main differences between the barriers identified by transport planners and environmental consultants are related to their assessment of the need for more collaborative work between key actors. It is finally discussed the added value of this research to progress towards the homogenization of EIA processes across countries. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.", Decision-making; Effectiveness; Environmental Impact Assessment; Public participation; Stakeholders; Transport,1.0
91,A low cost way for assessing bird risk hazards in power lines: Fixed-wing small unmanned aircraft systems,"Accidents on power lines are one of the most important causes of man-induced mortality for raptors and soaring birds. The factors that condition the hazard have been extensively studied, and currently there are a variety of technical solutions available to mitigate the risk. Most of the resources in conservation projects to reduce avian mortality now are invested in fieldwork to monitor the lines, which diverts the resources available to install actual corrective measures to mitigate bird hazard. Little progress has been achieved in the methodology to characterize line risk, which is an expensive, tedious, and time-consuming task. In this work we describe the use of low cost small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) equipped with on-board cameras for power line surveillance. As a case study, we characterized four power lines, geo-referenced every pylon in selected portions, and assessed their hazard for birds. We compare the effectiveness of two variants of the sUAS method for data acquisition and two methods of plane control. This work provides evidence of the usefulness of sUAS as a fast, inexpensive, and practical tool in conservation biology, adding to their already known applications in wildlife monitoring, the environmental impact assessment of infrastructures. © 2013, Canadian Science Publishing.

92,The design of public participation in Environmental Impact Assessments,"Public participation has become an important part in the Environmental Impact Assessment process. However, a few factors can affect, even change, its positive effect, including times when the public is to be involved, and the distribution of the necessary forms to the public involved. Therefore it is very important to pay attention to those factors and to design an integrated plan for public participation in the assessment process. In this article, the legal requirements for public participation are firstly set out, then current problems as well as the gaps between the practices and regulations of participation are analyzed. The design of a plan to improve the effectiveness of the assessment process, including designing principles, defining the roles of the different actors, setting standards for selecting the form(s) to involve participation of the public, and defining the times when the public is to be involved, is discussed.

93,Estimation of potential topsoil organic carbon loss due to industrial complex development: Implications for topsoil conservation in South Korea,"Organic carbon in topsoil plays an important role in carbon sequestration to mitigate climate change. Topsoil contains the highest amount of organic carbon in soil layers, and conserving topsoil can provide an important solution to climate change. In South Korea, an extensive amount of topsoil has been lost due to the development of industrial complexes through land conversion. This study aims to quantify the potential organic carbon losses resulting from reductions in forest and agricultural land caused by the development of industrial complexes over three years. Over the past decade, 6.2 % of the national agricultural land (equal to 1302.73 km2) and 1.2 % (equal to 801.68 km2) of forest land were lost. These losses in agricultural and forest land correspond to an estimated loss of soil organic carbon equal to 7,139,356 Mg from the agricultural land and 7,794,831 Mg from forest land. After mineralization, this can result in 551,606 and 1,637,011 Mg of CO2 being released in the atmosphere from agricultural and forest land respectively. The most significant finding of this study is that the average annual potential organic carbon losses from the reductions of agricultural and forest land due to the development of industrial complexes over a recent three-year period are respectively equivalent to 30 % and 90 % of the average annual nationwide loss over the past 10 years. This indicates the urgent need for effective topsoil management within the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) framework. We further examine the current state of topsoil management with the EIA framework, highlighting the need for improved management to mitigate the environmental impacts of topsoil loss. Our results highlight the substantial impact of land conversion on carbon sequestration, underscoring the need for effective topsoil management within the EIA framework. © 2024 The Authors", Carbon sequestration; Environmental impact assessment; Industrial complex development; Land conversion; Organic carbon estimates; Topsoil management,1.0
94,Following the “why? what? and how?” schema to improve road-kill evaluation in environmental impact assessments of Southern Brazil,"Environmental licensing is one of the most important tools of environmental policies in any country, as it allows to adopt preventive and mitigation measures on predicted or observed environmental impacts. However, Environmental Impact Assessments are recurrently criticized due to their low quality and effectiveness to support decisions for project viability or mitigation planning. One way to counteract those limitations is by strengthening terms of reference. Here we present the results of a collaborative initiative carried out in southernmost state of Brazil to improve terms of reference for assessments of vertebrate road mortality in a context of road widening. This initiative integrated contributions from stakeholders involved in road planning, construction, operation and road environmental assessments and licensing through a series of workshops undertaken during two years. Using the Why, What and How schema, we first briefly present the reasons to evaluate wildlifevehicle collisions in environmental assessments, and then we comment some limitations of current legal regulations and environmental impact assessments in Brazil and identify the improvements needed. We describe the approach and principles used to develop a sampling protocol for what and how to sample and how to analyze vertebrate road mortality data in Brazilian roads. Finally, we present the result of this effort, the guidelines itself. Although focused on a single road impact (road-kill), we expect that our approach could be replicated to produce guidelines to improve assessments of other road impacts and even other types of infrastructures or activities for which environmental licensing is a pre-requisite. © 2017, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

Holling (1978) has advocated EIA systems which are designed and implemented in such ways that they may adapt to continual uncertainty and take advantage of surprise, thus converting problems into opportunities. Canadian EIA researchers have criticized current EIA processes for their lack of effectiveness, efficiency and fairness, the infrequency and inconsistency of their application and their lack of integration with other processes such as planning, regulation and monitoring (Gibson and Patterson 1985; Gibson et al. 1987, Gibson 1988; Fenge 1985; Fenge and Rees 1987; Lang and Armour 1981; Rees 1981).

97,Evaluating the effectiveness of EIA review for onshore wind power projects in South Korea using multi-criteria analysis,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) systems play a crucial role in systematically reviewing and analyzing the potential environmental impacts of development plans, contributing significantly to environmental conservation. However, there is a growing demand to evaluate the practical effectiveness of EIA. This study introduces a novel quantitative assessment of EIA effectiveness, in contrast to the traditionally used qualitative approaches. A data-driven framework was employed to provide an objective measurement of environmental performance improvements before and after the EIA review. The overall objective of this study was to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of the EIA review process for onshore wind power projects (WPPs) in South Korea over the last decade (2013−2022) using an Environmental Assessment Index (EA-Index) based on a multi-criteria analysis. The EA-Index, comprising 23 indicators in three components (natural environment, resource conservation, and living and social environment), weighted by the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), provides a structured and objective method to measure environmental performance before and after an EIA review. The results showed a general improvement in environmental performance post-approval, with the average EA-Index for 79 WPPs increasing from 105.4 to 117.9 and success rates exceeding the reference value of 100 increasing from 60.8 % to 74.4 %. This improvement was driven by significant increases in the indicators within the natural environment. The significant improvements observed from 2017 to 2020 reflect the impact of the revised EIA guidelines and stricter evaluation criteria. This study highlights the need for tailored EIA guidelines to address site-specific characteristics, enhanced stakeholder engagement, and continuous policy refinement to support sustainable development. The EA-Index proved to be a robust tool for evaluating EIA effectiveness, providing critical policy implications and recommendations. © 2024", Effectiveness evaluation framework; Environmental assessment index (EA-index); Environmental quantification tool; Renewable energy projects; Sustainable development,1.0
98,Environmental impact assessment: the growing importance of science in government decision making,"The broad acceptance of the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Brundtland Report with its emphasis on environmentally sustainable development is a good indication that this concept is gaining world-wide recognition. Science and the ensuing technology must be credited for creating and sustaining our modern society and we must now apply our expertise to minimize the adverse impacts of industrial growth and preserve our environment. Real progress towards the reconciliation of economic and environmental goals will require effective incorporation of environmental impact assessment (EIA) into the planning process and this paper describes the steps taken to improve the concept and practice of EIA in Canada. Public trust and participation in the process are key ingredients for its success as well as good science and meaningful dialogue between the scientists, the public and the decision makers.

100,A synthetic method for atmospheric diffusion simulation and environmental impact assessment of accidental pollution in the chemical industry in a WEBGIS context,"The chemical industry poses a potential security risk to factory personnel and neighboring residents. In order to mitigate prospective damage, a synthetic method must be developed for an emergency response. With the development of environmental numeric simulation models, model integration methods, and modern information technology, many Decision Support Systems (DSSs) have been established. However, existing systems still have limitations, in terms of synthetic simulation and network interoperation. In order to resolve these limitations, the matured simulation model for chemical accidents was integrated into the WEB Geographic Information System (WEBGIS) platform. The complete workflow of the emergency response, including raw data (meteorology information, and accident information) management, numeric simulation of different kinds of accidents, environmental impact assessments, and representation of the simulation results were achieved. This allowed comprehensive and real-time simulation of acute accidents in the chemical industry. The main contribution of this paper is that an organizational mechanism of the model set, based on the accident type and pollutant substance; a scheduling mechanism for the parallel processing of multi-accident-type, multi-accident-substance, and multi-simulation-model; and finally a presentation method for scalar and vector data on the web browser on the integration of a WEB Geographic Information System (WEBGIS) platform.

101,An environmental assessment model applied to printed circuit board manufacturing,"Environmental consciousness in manufacturing is becoming increasingly important, due to market pressure and government regulations. As a result, there is an immediate need to develop a model which can effectively assess the impacts of pollution in manufacturing. In this paper, an environmental assessment model is developed based on the combining of the ""interval method"" with the network analytic method and fuzzy set theory. By applying fuzzy set theory and using on-site-measured pollution data, this model allows uncertain, interactive and dynamic information to be incorporated into the environmental impact assessment. The applicability of this model is demonstrated by a printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing case. It is concluded that this model is a simple, pragmatic and effective tool for analysing the relative impacts of waste emissions and evaluating the environmental performance of manufacturing processes. © Springer-Verlag London Limited 2007.", Environmental assessment; Fuzzy set theory; Network analysis,0.0

103,Strategies optimization to improve environmental benefit of chicken manure anaerobic digestion in China: Insight from life cycle assessment,"China's livestock industry produces substantial amounts of chicken manure (CM) annually, which contains high organic content and poses environmental pollution risks if improperly treated. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is an effective technology for mitigating CM pollution while enabling energy recovery and nutrient recycling. However, significant variations exist in process configurations across different chicken manure anaerobic digestion (CMAD) projects in China, necessitating comprehensive environmental impact assessments to guide optimal technological pathway selection. A comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) framework characterizing typical CMAD process routes was implemented and developed according to on-site investigations. The results demonstrated that CMAD shows significant environmental benefits, with an average carbon reduction potential of −597.75 kg CO2 eq./t dry CM (GWP100a). Improving AD efficiency and solid content represent the key determining factors for maximizing CMAD's carbon reduction potential. Concurrently, this potential can be further amplified by converting digestate into organic fertilizer. With the development of clean electricity in China, CMAD requires strategic transition from energy-oriented to resource-oriented recovery within an emission factor range of 0.15–0.22 kg CO2 eq./kWh to ensure long-term environmental sustainability. With advancements in AD technology and policy support, CMAD is projected to achieve an annual carbon reduction of 7.97 × 109 kg CO2 eq. by 2050, representing an 8.4 % reduction ratio for China's livestock manure management. This study offers valuable insights and strategic guidance for the future development direction of CMAD and confirms its potential contribution to China's carbon neutrality goal. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd", Anaerobic digestion; Biogas utilization; Carbon reduction potential; Chicken manure; Life cycle assessment,0.0
104,Land take and the effectiveness of project screening in Environmental Impact Assessment: Findings from an empirical study,"Land take is emerging as a global environmental concern, and is particularly critical in intensively developed and land-scarce regions. This paper seeks to understand the effectiveness of the screening stage of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in addressing land take. Screening is the stage where a decision is made as to whether an EIA is required for a project. In many jurisdictions, screening results in three pathways: full EIA directly, preliminary EIA only, or preliminary EIA followed by full EIA. We compared the land take of 217 projects triggering the different pathways in a study region in Italy over a 15-year time interval. Land take was quantified by overlaying the footprint of the projects with a land cover map. The results show that while more attention was given to projects with larger land take impacts overall, the cumulative land take from smaller projects not triggering full EIA was considerable (40% of overall land take). The case-by-case examination conducted through the preliminary EIA was found to work better for some project types (ski areas and small urban development), than for others (quarries). Our findings lead us to advocate improvements in current screening procedures to ensure that the land take impacts are quantified and made explicit in preliminary EIA reports. Our evidence-based approach to determining land take in EIA provides a compelling basis for understanding ways to improve EIA policies, guidance and practice. © 2017 The Authors", Case-by-case examination; Cumulative effects; Land loss; Land take; Preliminary EIA; Project screening,1.0

This research investigates the performance of an Indirect Solar Dryer (ISD) using three conditions in a solar collector: without Energy Storage Material (ESM), with ESM featuring paraffin wax as Phase Change Material (PCM), and with ESM incorporating aluminum flat coil inserted PCM. The experimentation took place under autumn and summer climatic conditions for drying Coccinia grandis. Six experimental scenarios have been directed to analyze the drying kinetics, energy, and environmental impacts. The initial moisture content of a 2.5 kg product reduced from 2.31 kg of water (92.5 % w.b) to 0.25 kg of water (10 % w.b) within 10.25 h using ISD with ESM equipped with aluminum flat coil inserted PCM during summer climatic condition (Scenario 6). Scenario 6 achieved a maximum thermal efficiency of about 21.056 %. Environmental impact assessment revealed an Energy Payback Time (EPT) of 1.44 years for scenario 6. In scenario 6, CO2 emissions, mitigation, and carbon credits amounted to 24.11 kg/year, 20.12 tons, and $100.6 to $402.4, respectively, over the expected 35-year lifespan. The research suggests that the developed ISD stands as a potentially effective commercial drying method, demonstrating better performance in terms of energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd", Coccinia grandis; Drying kinetics; Energy analysis; Environmental analysis; Indirect solar dryer; Phase change material,0.0

107,"Conceptualizing strategic environmental assessment: Principles, approaches and research directions","Increasing emphasis has been placed in recent years on transitioning strategic environmental assessment (SEA) away from its environmental impact assessment (EIA) roots. Scholars have argued the need to conceptualize SEA as a process designed to facilitate strategic thinking, thus enabling transitions toward sustainability. The practice of SEA, however, remains deeply rooted in the EIA tradition and scholars and practitioners often appear divided on the nature and purpose of SEA. This paper revisits the strategic principles of SEA and conceptualizes SEA as a multi-faceted and multi-dimensional assessment process. It is suggested that SEA can be conceptualized as series of approaches operating along a spectrum from less to more strategic – from impact assessment-based to strategy-based – with each approach to SEA differentiated by the specific objectives of SEA application and the extent to which strategic principles are reflected in its design and implementation. Advancing the effectiveness of SEA requires a continued research agenda focused on improving the traditional SEA approach, as a tool to assess the impacts of policies, plans and programs (PPPs). Realizing the full potential of SEA, however, requires a new research agenda — one focused on the development and testing of a deliberative governance approach to SEA that can facilitate strategic innovations in PPP formulation and drive transitions in short-term policy and initiatives based on longer-term thinking. © 2016 Elsevier Inc."," Multi-level perspective; Policies, plans and programs; Strategic environmental assessment; Strategic thinking; Strategic transitions; Transition management",1.0
108,Effectiveness of Environmental Impact Assessment system in Estonia,"To be effective, an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) system, first, has to minimize the probability that projects with significant environmental effects are implemented without EIA, and second, minimize the number of EIAs, which do not provide decision makers with essential information, so that the decision is improved as a result of EIA. The objective of this study was to find out how frequently in Estonia the projects implemented without EIA have caused significant environmental effects, and to measure the relative frequency of EIAs that have no influence on decision. An extensive survey with e-mail distributed questionnaires was carried out to reveal information from governmental agencies, local self-governments, and developers. There was no evidence that projects authorized without EIA have had environmental impacts, which could have been mitigated as a result of EIA. In contrast, about half of EIAs did not alter the decision of relevant authorities. This proportion was valid to both mandatory EIAs and those initiated on judgement basis. In our view, the proportion of no-influence EIAs was excessive and indicated the need to reconsider the provisions applying to the projects with a mandatory EIA requirement as well as judgements practice. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

This paper discusses the results of the second intergovernmental BBNJ conference, which took place March 25 - April 5, 2019, and analyzes the trends, variables, and obstacles shaping the emerging agreement. The paper considers the discussion surrounding each of the four elements of the BBNJ agenda in turn: area based management tools including marine protected areas, environmental impact assessments, marine genetic resources and access and benefit sharing, and capacity building and technology transfer. At the second session of negotiations, progress towards consensus on the four major elements of the BBNJ package was limited and uneven. Drawing on close observations, interviews with a variety of participants, and document analysis, we conclude that the dictum that the new BBNJ agreement “should not undermine” existing elements of the ocean governance regime serves to inhibit movement towards a consensual and effective instrument. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd", BBNJ; Environmental impact assessment; High seas; Marine genetic resources; MPAs; UNCLOS,1.0
111,Life cycle assessment of the environmental influence of wooden and concrete utility poles based on service lifetime,"Purpose: Many applications of life cycle assessment do not consider the variability of the service lifetime of different structures, and this may be a relevant factor in an environmental impact assessment. This paper aims to determine the influence of the service lifetime on the potential environmental impacts of wooden and concrete poles in the electricity distribution system. Methods: The estimation of service lifetime was conducted using the factorial method. The life cycle assessment was applied using SimaPro software and considered the entire life cycle of utility poles, from the extraction of raw materials to the final disposal. Then, an evaluation of the environmental impacts using the CML IA baseline method was performed. The study included the analysis of uncertainty using the Monte Carlo method. Results and discussion: In general, the wooden poles had a lower potential environmental impact compared to the concrete poles. The result of the sensitivity analysis considering the variability of the chromated copper arsenate wood preservative retention rate suggests that the frequency of maintenance affects the service lifetime. Often, the comparison of products in the LCA perspective is carried out by considering similar useful lifetime services for the different alternatives, and this study shows that the environmental performance of products or services is directly proportional to the lifetime. It is a crucial parameter that has to be clarified in order to reduce uncertainty in the results. Conclusions: Thus, some factors such as material quality, design adjustments and routine maintenance extend the service lifetime of a product or process and are shown to be effective ways to reduce environmental impacts. Therefore, the service lifetime has a significant influence on the development of the life cycle assessment. Comparative LCA studies are often sensitive to parameters that may even change the ranking of selected impact categories. All in all, from the sensitivity analysis highlighted in this study, the variability of lifetime service has proven to be one of the most prominent factors influencing comparative LCA results. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", Factorial method; Life cycle assessment; Life span; Maintenance; Wooden pole,0.0
112,Quality control mechanisms and environmental impact assessment effectiveness with special reference to the UK,"The fundamental components of an effective environmental impact assessment (EIA) system are formulated. It is proposed that EIA effectiveness can only be ensured if there are good quality control mechanisms in place. Nine categories of quality control are proposed: legislative, procedural, evaluative, professional, public/relevant agency, administrative, judicial, follow-up and international. These newly proposed mechanisms can be applied to gauge the completeness, comprehensiveness and effectiveness of existing EIA systems in a variety of social and political contexts. The UK environmental assessment system was used as an example to demonstrate how quality control mechanisms can be applied to evaluate EIA effectivness. It is concluded that considerable improvements could be made, particularly in legislative control, while public/relevant agency, professional and international controls have done much to raise EA quality in the UK.", ,1.0
113,Innovative software platform for eco-design of efficient electric motors,"Electric motors are one of the most common electrical components used both in industrial and household applications. In order to reduce world energy consumption and environmental impact, electric motors need to be improved in terms of efficiency and eco-sustainability. For this reason it is necessary to improve environmental consciousness, favouring the application of eco-design guidelines in the design phase, which is the most important stage where ""green"" solutions can be rapidly ideated, evaluated and optimized. Different aspects have to be concurrently considered in order to achieve a high quality product in a short time to market. In this context, the present paper describes an innovative web-based software platform to configure and simulate customized energy efficient electric motors. The core of the platform is a knowledge-based system which aims to standardize the design process according to the rules which represent the company know-how and best practices. The platform integrates different software tools to support the development from conceptual design to detailed design, and from the configuration of design solutions up to environmental impact assessment and manufacturing cost evaluation. It also provides a collaborative area in order to improve the collaboration among remote users involved in the design process, thanks to the sharing of important design data and models. The presented practical case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the platform application. The achieved results demonstrate the improvement of the configured solutions in comparison with the traditional adopted motors. The new motors exhibit both a considerable increase in energy efficiency and at the same time relevant improvement in product sustainability combined with acceptable production costs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

114,Tree planting and 'greening measures' - compensation or interference in nature and landscape; [Pflanzungen von Geholzen und 'Begrunung' ausgleich oder eingriff in natur und landschaft?],"Legislation of Environmental Impact Assessment prescribes the avoidance of damages to nature and landscape. If impacts cannot be avoided replacement or compensation measures have to be carried out. The latter often lead to the planting of trees and shrubs to improve the nature conservation value of the compensation site. Reality, however, often does not match this target. Most of the planted species do not correspond with the surrounding natural hedges, woodland edges and forests but are composed of unspecific or even arbitrary species combinations up to purely decorative plantings. The genetic diversity of the native flora, particularly of the wild roses, has been endangered by the mass-planting of nursery plants of unknown origin and often from foreign seeds. These facts prevent effective compensation but rather contribute to additional destruction of nature. To solve this problem it is suggested to use species typical for the landscape and raised from authochthonous seed. This is particularly important for plantings in the context of the construction of transport routes, of land reparcelling and of 'greening measures' around industrial estates.", ,1.0
115,"Comparative analysis of enabling legislation for EIA follow-up in Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan (and Aqaba)","The Middle East region has taken large strides in issuing legislations that protect the environment by using well-established tools such as environmental impact assessment and auditing. Ensuring compliance throughout the life cycles of development projects, however, remains a challenging task. This paper aims to show that despite the successes attained thus far, there are several drawbacks in the existing systems, most strikingly the weak linkages between the legal instruments such as EIA and auditing, the lack of provisions for public involvement and inadequate mechanisms and resource allocation for implementing follow-up. These weaknesses are likely contributing to less efficient and effective enforcement, lack of a holistic approach to environmental protection and insufficient financing for environmental mitigation and monitoring measures during the various stages of a development. As a comparative case study, the legislative framework for environmental impact assessment and auditing of Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan and Aqaba Special Economic Zone have been reviewed and analyzed.

116,Mechanical properties and environmental impact assessments of GFRP rebar reinforced limestone calcinated clay cement (LC3) concrete,"To address global greenhouse emissions, the adoption of green concrete materials has surged, aiming to lower CO₂ emissions and energy use over their lifecycle. This study comprehensively investigates the time-dependent degradation of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) rebars embedded in limestone calcined clay cement (LC3) concrete under exposure to water baths at temperatures of 23, 40 and 60 °C for up to 270 days. Both macroscopic mechanical testing (compressive strength of concrete, tensile test, flexural test and inter-laminar shear test of GFRP rebar, and pull-out test of GFRP-concrete) and environmental impact assessment are conducted to gain deeper insights. The experimental findings indicate that, when compared to normal concrete (NC), LC3 exhibits reduced aggressiveness towards the embedded GFRP rebars due to its lower alkaline content. Nonetheless, GFRP rebars still experience fiber corrosion, matrix cracking, and fiber-matrix debonding as a result of an alkaline attack from LC3. It is observed that GFRP rebar embedded in LC3 exhibit notable characteristics: an enhanced retention of tensile strength, escalating from 71.4 % to 93.3 % concerning the initial value, a similar retention in flexural and inter-laminar shear strength, and elevated ultimate bond strength from 1.83 % to 20.75 % at the GFRP-concrete interface relative to NC counterpart under identical environmental conditions. Further, these phenomena are explained by the micromorphology of aged GFRP rebars. Environmental impact assessment results show that compared with GFRP-NC, the proposed GFRP-LC3 has a lower impact on the environment, with a reduction of 20.27 % and 34.53 % for energy consumption and CO2 emissions, respectively. Considering the long-term mechanical properties and environmental impacts after degradation, GFRP-LC3 provides an effective approach for the sustainable development of construction. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd", CO<sub>2</sub> emission; Energy consumption; Environmental impact assessment; Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP); Limestone calcined clay cement (LC3); Mechanical properties,0.0
117,Integrated project evaluation and selection using multiple-attribute decision-making technique,"The evaluation and selection of industrial projects before investment decision is customarily done using marketing, technical and financial information. Subsequently, environmental impact assessment and social impact assessment are carried out mainly to satisfy the statutory agencies. Because of stricter environment regulations in developed and developing countries, quite often impact assessment suggests alternate sites, technologies, designs, and implementation methods as mitigating measures. This causes considerable delay to complete project feasibility analysis and selection as complete analysis requires to be taken up again and again till the statutory regulatory authority approves the project. Moreover, project analysis through above process often results sub-optimal project as financial analysis may eliminate better options, as more environment friendly alternative will always be cost intensive. In this circumstance, this study proposes a decision support system, which analyses projects with respect to market, technicalities, and social and environmental impact in an integrated framework using analytic hierarchy process, a multiple-attribute decision-making technique. This not only reduces duration of project evaluation and selection, but also helps select optimal project for the organization for sustainable development. The entire methodology has been applied to a cross-country oil pipeline project in India and its effectiveness has been demonstrated. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

118,Existing environmental management approaches relevant to deep-sea mining,"Deep-sea mining (DSM) may become a significant stressor on the marine environment. The DSM industry should demonstrate transparently its commitment to preventing serious harm to the environment by complying with legal requirements, using environmental good practice, and minimizing environmental impacts. Here existing environmental management approaches relevant to DSM that can be used to improve performance are identified and detailed. DSM is still predominantly in the planning stage and will face some unique challenges but there is considerable environmental management experience in existing related industries. International good practice has been suggested for DSM by bodies such as the Pacific Community and the International Marine Minerals Society. The inherent uncertainty in DSM presents challenges, but it can be addressed by collection of environmental information, area-based/spatial management, the precautionary approach and adaptive management. Tools exist for regional and strategic management, which have already begun to be introduced by the International Seabed Authority, for example in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Project specific environmental management, through environmental impact assessment, baseline assessment, monitoring, mitigation and environmental management planning, will be critical to identify and reduce potential impacts. In addition, extractive companies’ internal management may be optimised to improve performance by emphasising sustainability at a high level in the company, improving transparency and reporting and introducing environmental management systems. The DSM industry and its regulators have the potential to select and optimize recognised and documented effective practices and adapt them, greatly improving the environmental performance of this new industry. © 2019 The Authors", Blue economy; Environmental impact assessment; Management systems; Mitigation; Monitoring; Seabed mining industry,1.0
119,Environmental applications of magnetometry profiling,"Environmental impact assessment is currently a standard procedure for assessing the possible consequences of any particular activity that may cause degradation of the environment. Magnetometry profiling, which involves accurate measurements of the Earth's magnetic field at closely spaced stations is a technique that has a large number of environmental applications that can greatly improve this assessment. The technique has been applied successfully for waste disposal site evaluation, toxic waste detection, assessment of the quality of roadstone before excavations and can provide information that allows subsurface water movement models to be refined. Magnetometry profiling is inexpensive, nondestructive, and a very cost-effective method of acquiring useful information about the environment.", Environment; Faults; Ireland; Magnetometry profiling,1.0
120,Ecological mitigation measures in English Environmental Impact Assessment,"Built development is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss in the UK. Major built developments usually require an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to be conducted, which frequently includes an Ecological Impact Assessment (EcIA) chapter. By identifying the flaws in EcIA mitigation measure proposals and their implementation in completed developments, it may be possible to develop measures to reduce biodiversity loss and help meet the UK's EU obligation to halt biodiversity loss by 2020.A review of 112 English EcIAs from 2000 onwards was conducted to provide a broad-scale overview of the information provision and detail of ecological mitigation measures. Audits of seven EIA development case study sites provided finer-scale detail of mitigation measure implementation, and the effectiveness of their grassland and marginal habitat creation and management measures was assessed using standard NVC methodology. Despite higher than expected levels of mitigation measure implementation in completed developments, EcIA mitigation proposal information and detail has seen little improvement since a 1997 review, and the effectiveness of the habitat mitigation measures studied was poor. This suggests that measures to improve ecological mitigation measures are best targeted at ecological consultants. A recommendation for EcIA-specific training of Competent Authorities is also made. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.", Biodiversity; Ecological Impact Assessment; Habitat creation; Monitoring; Planning,1.0
121,Developing concentric logical concepts of environmental impact assessment systems: Feng Shui concerns and beyond,"This study examines areas of weakness in environmental impact assessment (ElA) systems due to uncertainty and risk. It then introduces the Oriental concepts of feng shui and wu xing to systematic interventions of fair utility and equitable allocation in response to the identified weaknesses with the goal of improving the practical implementation of EIA systems. Following this concentric logic, we developed a concept similar to the wave image of neutrons, which consists of three concentric circles: an interior circle known as the environmental element circle, a middle circle known as the integrated circle, and an exterior circle known as the academic tool circle. A legislative backup system underpins the entire theoretical framework, including regulations, follow-up assessments, and public consultation processes. This paper also examines Taiwanese efforts to promote concepts of EIA systems through dialogue between Western and Eastern science (geomancy) forums. Similar efforts can be seen in ancient Chinese, Korean, and Japanese cultures, as well as in Vaishnavism and Hinduism, which developed an understanding of the relationship between geography and physics and the balance between various components of the universe. These concepts are equally applicable today. Furthermore, we optimized an EIA methodology using a linear development process and locating system elements and tools. Finally, we attempted to complete an ideal and effective EIA system with comprehensive assessment technology. © 2013, Locke Science Publishing Company, Inc.

122,"Constitutional and Judicial Interpretation of Environmental Laws in Nigeria, India and Canada","The judiciary, an important branch of government responsible for legal interpretation, dispute resolution, and justice administration, holds a crucial role in national environmental protection. Courts play a key role in safeguarding a nation's environment by interpreting constitutional provisions related to environmental protection and other legislative frameworks. The effectiveness of a country's environmental protection is contingent on the assertiveness, creativity, and innovation of its judiciary in interpreting laws, policies, and regulations designed for environmental preservation. The widely held belief is that the judiciary, more than any other institution, is best positioned to adjudicate, inform, guide, and lead in environmental protection. A proactive, inventive, and inspirational judiciary motivates the executive and legislative branches to implement pertinent environmental laws, policies, and regulations. This study utilizes a doctrinal research methodology to comprehensively review and compare the environmental protection frameworks in Nigeria, India, and Canada. The focus is on constitutional provisions related to environmental protection and judicial interpretations, particularly in the context of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) laws. While explicit constitutional provisions on environmental protection are absent in Canada, India, and Nigeria, the courts in India and Canada have demonstrated creative interpretation of their constitutions to safeguard the environment. Notably, in India, environmental protection falls under the non-adjudicable Directive Principles of State Policy (DPSP). © 2023, Universitas Negeri Semarang.

123,Geothermal energy resources in Ethiopia: Status review and insights from hydrochemistry of surface and groundwaters,"Ethiopia has an estimated >10,000 MW of geothermal energy potential, more than double its current power generating capacity (4,400 MW). Electricity access stands at 44% of the total population, with 31% in rural areas, so effective development of this low-carbon resource could make a significant impact to equitable delivery of electricity. However, geothermal energy exploitation must be done responsibly to protect valuable water resources under stress from climate-change driven drought conditions and competing uses across agricultural, domestic, and industrial sectors. Our review provides progress updates on geothermal developments—which soon aim to deliver more than 1,000 MW of electricity—and performs a high-level assessment of hydrochemical data for ground and surface waters across Ethiopia. A water quality database was built using publicly available information and three quality control criteria: well-defined sample location, cation-anion balance (CAB) of ±10%, and clear fluid type definition. Ethiopia hosts two major geothermal water types, sodium-alkalinity dominated in the Main Ethiopian Rift and sodium-chloride dominated in the Afar Depression, separated by sodium-mixed waters between Dofan-Fantale and Meteka. H and O stable isotopes suggest a largely meteoric source for geothermal waters, with δ18O enrichment adding to evidence of a high enthalpy resource at Tendaho. Hydrochemical investigations provide critical information for successful delivery of sustainable geothermal energy developments. However, the current lack of data available for Ethiopia poses a significant challenge for completion of predevelopment baselines and ongoing environmental impact assessment. We encourage the release of unpublished findings from private companies and government agencies to build upon our database and demonstrate social and environmental responsibility in the development of Ethiopian geothermal resources.

124,"Degradation factors and their environmental impacts on the mangrove ecosystem of the Mallorquin Lagoon, Colombian Caribbean","Mangrove forests are threatened by natural and anthropogenic factors resulting in their degradation and the loss of the ecosystem services they provide. The analysis of degradation factors (DFs) is essential to guide mangrove conservation efforts. The aims of this study were to identify DFs and perform an environmental impact assessment (EIA) on their impacts over the mangroves of Mallorquin Lagoon, Colombian Caribbean. The main mangrove DFs were documented during field campaigns. Also, mangrove structural characteristics, physicochemical conditions, and pollutant concentrations in water and sediments were measured to determine the ecosystem degradation status. Subsequently, the qualitative methodology of EIA allowed calculating the importance of the impacts resulting from DFs on the ecosystem components. The main DFs identified were wastewater discharges, unregulated litter dumps, mangrove logging, and urban sprawl. Mangrove species in Mallorquin Lagoon included Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa, and Avicennia germinans, the latter being the one with the highest density, basal area, and importance value index. Mangrove sediments showed high concentrations of Cu, Ni, Cr, and Zn that could lead to adverse effects on the mangrove's aquatic organisms. The EIA indicated that water and soil quality were severely impacted by wastewater discharges. While unregulated litter dumps had moderate impacts, mangrove logging and urban sprawl caused significant changes in the ecosystem, critically impacting water, soil, and forest integrity. Efficient control of urban sprawl, ecological restoration of the deteriorated areas and effective environmental protection measures are required to conserve Mallorquin Lagoon, a fragmented Ramsar wetland. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists.", Coastal wetlands; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental management; Mangrove pollution; Urban sprawl,0.0
125,Method of Greenhouse Gas Environmental Impact Assessment for Construction Projects; [建设项目温室气体环境影响评价方法研究],"Establishing a sound regulatory system that synergistically controls environmental pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is an important basis for achieving a high-quality peak in China's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Effective control of additional CO2 emissions is the key for key industrial sectors to reach their peak carbon emissions ahead of the schedule. In China, environmental impact assessment (EIA) is a basic policy for the prevention and control of environmental pollution source. Incorporating GHG emission regulation into the existing EIA system is a feasible and important way for a synergetic control of environmental pollution and GHG emissions. Given this management requirement, we propose an approach to incorporate GHG emission regulations into the EIA for construction projects in China, with implications from domestic and foreign management practices considered. Basic principles for EIA on GHG emissions are proposed, that is, conducting assessments in systemic, whole-process, and synergetic manners. In addition, key factors that will affect GHG emissions of construction projects are identified. We further establish an index system, which emphasis high efficiency, low carbon, and recycling, for the assessment. The assessment procedure is then proposed, including project analysis, influencing factors identifications, impact predictions and technical analysis, and comprehensive environmental impact assessments. Based on the proposed approach, this study evaluated the potential changes in the national CO2 emissions induced by a project that plans to transfer 250×104 t of electrolytic aluminum production capacity from Shandong Province to Yunnan Province. It is estimated that the national CO2 emission could be reduced by 2574.4×104 t, when the impacts of inter-regional power transmission from Yunnan Province is not considered. In contrast, when considering this impact of inter-regional power transmission, the national net CO2 emission reduction is estimated to be 968.3×104 t. Furthermore, if more factors, such as technological upgrading and local coal consumption policies, are taken into account, substantially different assessment results could be obtained. The proposed approach for EIA on GHG emissions can provide a theoretical basis for the establishment of relevant regulatory systems in China. The case analysis indicates that the estimated changes in the CO2 emissions could differ substantially when considering different assessment objectives, assessment boundaries, and influencing factors, implying that the evaluation objectives and boundaries should be reasonably determined based on project realities and overall requirements.

The scientific research's importance lies in the fact that the choice of environmental risk management instrument to be employed within the framework of corporate governance in companies is of paramount importance to avoid or mitigate the threefold environmental liability to which they are exposed. Objective: The present study aims to elucidate whether Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) proves to be efficient, effective, and efficacious in fulfilling the duty of protecting environmental equilibrium. Methodology: To this end, analyses were carried out regarding environmental risk and environmental harm, from the perspective of the socio-environmental role of companies in contemporary society, the necessity for a new corporate approach, and the question of the suitability or unsuitability of EIA as a model for managing environmental risks and harms in companies. The deductive approach method was employed, with research conducted using the bibliographic procedure method, involving searches in books, scientific articles, and legislations. Results: The result indicates the inefficacy, ineffectiveness, and lack of efficacy of EIA for environmental risk management and, consequently, for fulfilling the duty of protecting environmental equilibrium by companies. © 2023, UNIVALI.

127,Theorising EIA effectiveness: A contribution based on the Danish system,"Considerable attention has been given to the effectiveness of environmental impact assessment (EIA) since the 1970s. Relatively few research studies, however, have approached EIA as an instrument of environmental governance, and have explored the mechanisms through which EIA influences the behaviour of actors involved in planning processes. Consequently, theory in this area is underspecified. In this paper we contribute to theory-building by analysing the effectiveness of a unique EIA system: the Danish system. In this system the competent authority, instead of the project proponent, undertakes EIA reporting. Additionally, the public, rather than experts, play a central role in quality control and the Danish EIA community is relatively small which influences community dynamics in particular ways. A nation-wide survey and expert interviews were undertaken in order to examine the views of actors involved in EIA on the effectiveness of this anomalous system. The empirical data are compared with similar studies on governance mechanisms in other countries, especially the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, as well as with earlier evaluations of EIA effectiveness in Denmark. The results indicate that the more extensive role attributed to the competent authority may lead to higher EIA effectiveness when this aligns with their interests; the influence of the public is amplified by a powerful complaints system; and, the size of the EIA community appears to have no substantial influence on EIA effectiveness. We discuss how the research findings might enhance our theoretical understanding of the operation and effectiveness of governance mechanisms in EIA. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.", Context; Denmark; Effectiveness; Environmental assessment; Governance mechanisms,1.0
128,"A systemic analysis of the environmental impacts of gold mining within the blyde river catchment, a strategic water area of south africa","Exploratory modelling of the impact of gold mining on groundwater in a strategic water area of South Africa was undertaken. A systems dynamics (SD) model was developed to simulate the impact of gold mining on water quality, focusing on groundwater contamination risk, within the context of competing developmental priorities around water resource development and the so-cio‐economic gains from gold mining. The model also identified interventions to minimise the impacts by the year 2040. The study area was the Blyde River Catchment (BRC), which is part of the Olifants Water Management Area in South Africa. This area is an important contributor, currently and in the future, to freshwater flows and groundwater in the Olifants River Catchment, which is one of South Africa’s most economically important catchments. The model development process included a causal loop diagram–based problem conceptualisation, followed by the drawing of stock‐flow diagrams and the determining of model parameters based on a combination of background literature, data from environmental impact assessments, and from the national Department of Water and Sanitation. The model showed the potential environmental risks of gold mine wastewater production and interventions to minimise these risks. The most effective intervention identified to reduce the risk of groundwater contamination was the development and use of syn-thetic‐lined tailings dams. The baseline simulation result of sulphate loading of 5430 t/year can be reduced by 3070 t/year to give a simulated sulphate load of 2270 t/year in 2040 using this intervention. In comparison, the simulated wastewater recycling intervention only reduced the sulphate load to 4630 t/year and the wastewater treatment interventions to 3420 t/year. This project contributes to the exploratory modelling of an understudied region of the Olifants River Catchment that is a crucial provider of freshwater flows to the Olifants, which is threatened by increasing gold mining in the upper BRC. The SD model highlighted the importance of protecting the dolomitic aquifers in the BRC for the long term sustainability of the catchment, which is particularly important if groundwater development occurs. © 2021 by the authors.

This study is mainly focused on review, update and comparison of EIA systems between these three countries. It is intended to clarify fundamental information of the EIA systems and characteristics of the key elements of EIA processes (screening, consideration of alternatives, prediction or evaluation of impact, and public participation). Moreover, the number of the EIA projects that have been implemented in all the provinces in Thailand are presented. The results identified the similarities and differences of the EIA processes among the three aforementioned countries. The type of EIA report used in Thailand, unlike those in China and Japan, is an Environmental and Health Impact Assessment (EHIA), which is concerned with the health and environmental impacts that could occur from the project. In addition, EIA reports in Thailand are made available to the public online and the shortcomings of the process have details of barriers resulting from the projects to help future projects with reconsideration and improvements. In this study, it is pointed out that Thai's EIA system still lacks local EIA authority which needs to be empowered by implementing a set of laws or ordinance. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.", China; Environmental impact assessment; Japan; Thailand,1.0
130,"An 'effective' involvement of indigenous people in environmental impact assessment: The cultural impact assessment of the Saru River Region, Japan","The Cultural Impact Assessment of the Saru River Region represents the first time that a site investigation was implemented in Japan in order to preserve an ethnic culture in relation to the construction of a dam. One of the project's basic concepts was to get local residents, especially those of Ainu ethnicity, to participate in the investigation. Existing case studies of environmental impact assessment have argued that the assessment has failed to sufficiently involve Indigenous people in its process and has largely failed to incorporate Indigenous knowledge, cultural values, and voices into its processes and outcomes. Also, intangible aspects of Indigenous cultural heritage have not been protected. In the Cultural Impact Assessment of the Saru River Region, the Final Report was released in 2006 and significantly included the 3 year investigation of input by local residents. In this sense, this assessment succeeded in effectively involving Indigenous people in its process and in reflecting their cultural values in its results. The more important issue is, however, how these results were included in the final outcomes. If Indigenous people have no power over final decision making, their involvement is not effective.

131,Europeanisation and multi-level environmental governance in a post-conflict context: the gradual development of environmental impact assessment processes in Bosnia-Herzegovina,"The post-conflict case of Bosnia-Herzegovina provides a challenging case for the approaches employed by the European Union to bolster state and non-state actor capacities related to environmental governance in post-socialist states. This article examines four major consultative environmental impact assessment processes in Bosnia-Herzegovina in order to identify factors that either enable or impede the development of multi-level environmental governance at the state and sub-state entity levels. Larger environmental non-governmental organisations provide scientific opinions and smaller organisations lack capacity to participate at all. The complex configuration of state institutions, compounded by inadequate staffing and funding, creates impediments for effective governmental hierarchy during environmental impact assessments. However, international financial institutions and technical consultants involved in environmental impact assessments have taken a pivotal tutelage role to familiarise local stakeholders with best practice, which has led to some improvements in multi-level environmental governance during environmental impact assessments in Bosnia-Herzegovina, though the impact is dependent on staff retention in Bosnian public bodies. © 2015, The Authors 2015.", Bosnia-Herzegovina; environmental governance; environmental impact assessment; Europeanisation; Western Balkans,1.0

Method: This is a study with a mixed approach (quantitative-qualitative). Data were collected from professionals who work in environmental licensing in the Federal District, Brazil, applying the method of survey by sestructured questionnaires. A systematic review of the literature was also conducted to compare the academic results with the perceptions of the professionals. Results and conclusion: The negative perception of environmental licensing by professionals endorses the results of academic studies that have focused on the problems of the effectiveness of this instrument. Although the perception of the professionals is negative, most believe that the instrument is important for the mitigation of negative socio-environmental impacts. Improvement measures were suggested in the research. Implications of the research: Highlights factors that interfere with the effectiveness of environmental licensing and proposes recommendations for improving the instrument in line with the principles of sustainable development. Originality: The work contributes to the academic debate on the factors that interfere in the effectiveness of environmental licensing, promoting subsidies for the improvement of the instrument and for the decision-making process of public managers. © 2024 ANPAD - Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Administracao.

133,Understanding stakeholder experiences with visual communication in environmental impact assessment,"Visual communication is widely and commonly used in environmental impact assessment (EIA) practice by all stakeholders. It includes maps, photographs, tables, info-graphics and other images used in environmental impact statements, as well as videos and graphics in online materials or in face-to-face consultation sessions (e.g., posters and PowerPoint presentations). The purpose of this research was to understand the practice of visual communication in EIA, focusing upon the perceptions and experiences of stakeholders. Surveys were conducted with international EIA practitioners along with observations of consultation sessions for three EIA projects in Portugal and interviews with proponents, regulators and members of the public involved. Specific focus was on (i) understanding stakeholder perspectives on the advantages and disadvantages of visual communication in EIA; (ii) proponent perceptions about the creation and use of visual communication; and (iii) public perceptions regarding their understanding and experience of visual communication as recipients of this material during public engagement in EIA. The mode and content of presentation, visual literacy of stakeholders and technical arrangements interact to determine the efficacy of visual communication. All stakeholders expected visual communication to be employed in EIA, but proponents and public were found to have low visual literacy. Proponents had pre-conceived notions for visual communication, without considering the needs of their audience, resulting in complex content being delivered inappropriately – too fast, without opportunity for reflection and dialogue. Frustrated public recipients tended to distrust proponents and be opposed to their projects, an unintended emotional response arising from cognition challenges with visual communication, combined with insufficient time for explanation, interpretation, and dialogue. This paper seeks to trigger reflection by practitioners and researchers on how and by whom visual communication in EIA should be designed, and what inhibits their comprehension and understanding. Considering visual literacy levels of EIA stakeholdersand tailoring the mode and style of delivery accordingly is critical for effective visual communication. © 2023", Co-design; Environmental impact assessment; Public engagement; Visual communication; Visual literacy,1.0

Despite difficulties, policy-makers are occasionally attracted to the idea of standardizing EIA methods. The objective of this study was to understand the merits of standardizing methods for impact prediction and significance evaluations, using Brazil as the empirical context. Based on a content analysis of 49 EIA reports, a survey with 126 practitioners, and a critical evaluation of two standardization initiatives, the study shows that, while generally perceived as beneficial, the standardization of EIA methods is likely to remain a rather challenging task in the foreseeable future. The high degrees of discretion taking place in the selection and implementation of impact prediction and significance evaluations are to a large extent a consequence of the difficulty of finding terminology, metrics, criteria, thresholds, boundaries, and values across different settings. Current standardization initiatives in Brazil are targeting some of the easiest methodological issues related to terminology and process. While relevant to administrative efficiency and process predictability, such issues represent a small piece of the complex puzzle of EIA effectiveness. Findings signal the need for clearer policy priorities, capacity building, and more applied research about the actual, long-term effects of standardization initiatives. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.", Brazil; EIA methods; Environmental impact assessment; Impact prediction; Impact significance; Standardization,1.0
135,Evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation measures in environmental impact assessments: A comprehensive review of development projects in Korea,"Rapid urbanization and development projects in Korea have posed significant threats to biodiversity; thus, effective mitigation measures are required to preserve natural habitats. Nevertheless, the factors underlying variations in mitigation measure effectiveness according to the disturbance level and surrounding environmental conditions have not been clarified. This study evaluated the effectiveness of mitigation measures implemented in environmental impact assessments (EIAs) of development projects in Korea, with a focus on their effectiveness with respect to the disturbance level and surrounding environmental conditions. A review of 288 EIA reports from selected projects that implemented all 10 mitigation measures classified according to the Wildlife Conservation Comprehensive Plan was conducted. Using the biodiversity tipping point framework, the effects of mitigation measures on biodiversity were categorized into four levels and analyzed. Analysis of variance and redundancy analysis were then performed to discern the variance in mitigation measure effectiveness in terms of the disturbance level, surrounding environment, and species. The results revealed significant variations in the effectiveness of mitigation measures depending on the surrounding environment and disturbance level. Linear projects exhibited a clear impact on various species as the disturbance level increased, whereas area-based projects did not exhibit such pronounced effects. All species demonstrated a negative relationship with development duration, development area, and distance from urban centers. Notably, avian and amphibian species showed a strong negative correlation with the digital elevation model while reptiles and mammals exhibited a strong positive relationship with pre-development biodiversity and distance from protected areas, respectively. Mitigation measures play a key role in alleviating the adverse effects of development projects; therefore, our findings indicate the need for spatially tailored mitigation plans to augment their effectiveness. © 2024", Decision-making support; Effectiveness analysis; Mitigation measures; Post-environment impact assessment; Terrestrial animals,1.0
136,Environmental Impact Assessment of Economic Activity: Problems of Modeling and Mapping,"A theoretical framework for environmental impact assessment of economic activity is formulated by using methods of mathematical modeling and thematic mapping. Theoretically, environment is considered as a surface of variety (manifold), linking various factors and conditions. Tangential planes to the surface correspond to any natural systems (ecosystems), individual according to their connections with the environment (points of tangency). An example of the display of the environmental variety is provided by landscape-typological maps of a territory. The equation of the plane specifies connections of factor parameters of ecosystems by taking into account their shift relative to environmental coordinates of these reference points. Different types of systemic interpretations of these equations (types of models) are formed with various quantitative criteria for change of in environmental status, such as the measures of responsibility and effectiveness of decisions made. Environmental impact assessment methods generally estimate changes in the state of natural systems rather than the transformation of their environment. Therefore, methods of distinguishing relevant indicators and selecting the characteristic features of their controlled changes are suggested. The antisymmetry of variability and stability is naturally discernible from the factors and conditions of economic activity, which is demonstrated by modeling the impact of economic processes on the environmental status: an assessment was made of the influence of the size of gross regional product on amounts of atmospheric emissions of pollutants as well as of waste water discharges on human health. The findings can be used in developing methods of mathematical modeling of the relationships between the ecological, economic and social blocks of territorial systems in order to solve problems of thematic mapping and seek optimal solutions in the field of environmental management. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.", environmental impact assessment; environmental variety; factors and conditions; mathematical modeling; thematic mapping,0.0
137,Evaluation of the effectiveness and performance of environmental impact assessment studies in Greece,"As environmental management is becoming increasingly complex, adequate assessment techniques must be utilized to forecast environmental impact trends. The current study aims to investigate the effectiveness of the evaluation system in Greece regarding environmental impact assessment (EIA) concerning projects. Data were extracted from literature and a questionnaire, which was distributed electronically on a Pan-Hellenic scale. Results indicated that the EIA system in Greece has solid foundations with a weak point regarding implementation. Strengths, weaknesses, and threats of EIA institution were analyzed through SWOT-AHP (Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats and Analytical Hierarchy Process) analysis. A dominant criterion in the analysis due to the dynamic of the deep economic recession was found to be the economic crisis. © 2023 Elsevier Masson SAS.

138,The roles of cleaner production in the sustainable development of modern societies: an introduction to this special issue,"This issue of the Journal of Cleaner Production is based upon papers presented at the 1st International Workshop Advances in Cleaner Production (CP) held in São Paulo, Brazil, in 2007. The conference had the short-term purpose of deepening the Brazilian discussion on ""The Roles of Cleaner Production in the Sustainable Development of Modern Societies"", and it had the long-term objective of providing an on-going interdisciplinary forum for knowledge development and exchange on Cleaner Production (CP) and Sustainable Development. This issue is devoted to papers covering a broad range of perspectives of CP practices and strategies. A special focus is placed upon methodological tools designed to support effective decision-making pertaining to quantitative benefits from CP. The ten papers provide insights from research designed to holistically integrate CP to help society make effective progress to sustainability. Papers cover the importance of informal knowledge, as complementary to formal knowledge, in performing effective 'Environmental Impact Assessments.' One paper explores the roles of radical and incremental innovation in the context of alternative automotive technologies. Benefits of Ecodesign are explored in two papers; one concerning its integration with remanufacturing to extend the life of used products and one focusing the adoption of 'Emergy Environmental Accounting,' as a complementary decision-making tool. The development of the Brazilian LCI database for 'hydroelectric power generation' and its contribution to support regionally relevant LCA studies is highlighted in one paper. The complete production chains of biodiesel and bioethanol are evaluated by using global methodologies, which help in the development of more objective and effective solutions. A ""compensatory area"", calculated in terms of emergy, is proposed in order to work in a sustainable way for bamboo production. Finally, a paper about a novel approach for recycling used PET is also included. © 2009.", Automotive industry; Biodiesel; Bioethanol; Cleaner production; Ecodesign; EIA; Emergy; Exergy; Hydroelectricity; Innovation; LCI; Remanufacturing; Sustainable development,1.0
139,Environmental impact assessment: Improving processes and techniques,"Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a commonly applied mechanism for managing adverse environmental effects of development. While there are widespread requirements for undertaking EIAs within Australia, there remain limitations in the capacity to meet all expectations. Such limitations are mostly apparent in relation to land use planning, natural resource management and the assessment of cumulative environmental impacts. Improved methods and procedures are needed to achieve more effective development planning and natural resource management and to implement the principles of ecologically sustainable development. They include improved information systems, better scoping mechanisms, more rigorous predictive modelling and broader assessment methods including area-wide and strategic environmental assessments. © 1995 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", ,1.0
140,Accounting for environmental quality in water resources planning.,"Environmental laws and regulations enacted during the 1970s in the United States required that environmental factors be accounted for in planning many types of facilities. New requirements led to much research on how environmental considerations could be effectively integrated into all stages of project planning. Elements of this research relevant to water resources planners and engineers are summarized below in the following topical areas: impact identifications typologies - categorizations of environmental impacts commonly associated with typical water resources projects; forecasting procedures - techniques for predicting the magnitude and extent of a water project's environmental impacts; Evaluation methods - procedures for evaluating alternative project proposals in terms of environmental, social and economic impacts; agency implementation surveys - analyses of environmental impact assessment (EIA) practices of water resources agencies; policy enhancement studies - investigations of how the effectiveness of agency EIA's can be increased.

141,Examining the global warming potential of hempcrete in the United States: A cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment,"In the United States reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with building construction by 90% by 2050 necessitates significant measures to be undertaken within the construction industry. Such measures include advanced construction techniques and bio-based material solutions such as hempcrete. This paper explores the mix design development and environmental impact assessment of hempcrete with an aim of reducing embodied impacts and achieving carbon negativity. Hempcrete being increasingly incorporated into both conventional and cutting-edge construction methods such as large-scale 3D printing is recognized as a carbon-negative material due to sequestered carbon in its constituent materials. Particularly, with the high carbon footprint associated with traditional Portland cement concrete, hempcrete presents a viable and low-carbon or even carbon-negative option for emerging construction techniques. The degree to which hempcrete achieves carbon negativity is contingent upon the proportion of hemp and lime within the mix design. Consequently, a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is essential for evaluating the carbon-reduction potential of hempcrete. This study conducts a cradle-to-gate LCA of various hempcrete mix designs including a hybrid LCA of the environmental impact of domestically cultivated hemp. The results show that the global warming potential (GWP) of industrial hemp is −1.72 kgCO2e/kg. The LCA of different mix designs reveals that carbon negativity is reached when the hempcrete composition includes no less than 20% hemp by weight. Moreover, findings underscore the importance of including lime's carbon absorption in calculations to attain carbon negativity as incorporation of hemp alone may not be adequate. The study concludes that optimizing the constituents of hempcrete to achieve carbon negativity is vital for effective climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. © 2024 The Authors", Biobased material; Biogenic carbon; Global warming potential; Hempcrete; Life cycle assessment; Uncertainty analysis,0.0
142,Is EIA part of the wind power planning problem?,"This research evaluates the importance and effectiveness of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) within wind farm planning debates, drawing on insights from case studies in Scotland. Despite general public support for renewable energy on the grounds that it is needed to tackle climate change and implement sustainable development, many proposed wind farms encounter significant resistance. The importance of planning issues and (EIA) processes has arguably been overlooked within recent wind farm social acceptability discourse. Through semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders and textual analysis of EIA documents, the characteristics of EIA are assessed in terms of its perceived purpose and performance. The data show that whilst respondents perceive EIA to be important, they express concerns about bias and about the inability of EIA to address climate change and wind farm decommissioning issues adequately. Furthermore, the research identifies key issues which impede the effectiveness of EIA, and reveals differences between theoretical and practical framings of EIA. The paper questions the assumption that EIA is a universally applicable tool, and argues that its effectiveness should be analysed in the context of specific development sectors. The article concludes by reviewing whether the recently amended EIA Directive (2014/52/EU) could resolve identified problems within national EIA practice. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.", EIA; Planning; Wind farms,1.0
143,"Anthropogenic disturbances and their impact on vegetation in Western Himalaya, India","The present study assesses anthropogenic disturbances and their impacts on the vegetation in Western Himalaya, India on the basis of various disturbance parameters such as density, Total Basal Cover (TBC) of cut stumps, lopping percentage and grazing intensities. On the basis of canopy cover and frequency of disturbances (%), the studied forests were divided into highly disturbed (HD), moderately disturbed (MD) and least disturbed (LD) categories. The HD forests had the lowest canopy cover, lowest density and lowest TBC and the LD had the highest canopy cover, highest density and highest TBC. The MD forests occupied the intermediate position with respect to these parameters. Species richness was least in HD forests, highest in one of the MD forests while LD forest occupied an intermediate position. The percentage of regenerating species was lowest (54%) in HD and highest (72%) in MD. The density of seedlings and saplings was higher in one of the MD forests as compared to HD and LD. We concluded that the moderate disturbances do not affect the vegetation adversely; however the increased degree of disturbance causes loss in plant diversity; affects regeneration and changes community characteristics. Construction of hydroelectric projects at various places in the study area was found to be one of the most important sources of anthropogenic disturbances in addition to the routine anthropogenic disturbances like grazing, fuelwood collection and fodder extraction. If all proposed dams in the Indian Himalaya are constructed combined with weak national environmental impact assessment and implementation, it will result in a significant loss of species. Therefore, various agents of disturbances should be evaluated in cumulative manner and any developmental activities such as hydropower projects, which trigger various natural and anthropogenic disturbances, should be combined with proper cumulative environmental impact assessment and effective implementation to minimise the anticipated loss of vegetation. © 2016, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", Conservation management; Human impact; Hydroelectric project; Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary; Species diversity; Tree regeneration,1.0
144,How does the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process affect environmental performance? Unveiling EIA effectiveness in China: A practical application within the thermal power industry,"Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are widely accepted by organizations worldwide, despite differences in cultural backgrounds and political and environmental management systems. In recent years, the EIA process in China has been increasingly customized to national political intent and the legislative framework. Meanwhile, the substantive effectiveness of EIAs has become a widespread concern, indicating that the effectiveness of EIAs is gauged by their capacity to reduce the negative impacts of plans, projects, and programs (PPPs). In this study, using policy analysis, we identified how EIAs influenced the effectiveness and compatibility of other environmental regulations, as well as the interrelationships between them. This study examined coordinated efforts in the national thermal power industry to reduce pollutant emissions within the constraints of EIA approval. The results revealed that the EIA process could assist in reducing pollutant emissions without impeding economic development in China, with the unique characteristics of the Chinese EIA system playing a significant role. As a mandatory policy in China, EIAs helped curb the cumulative regional pollution caused by rapid industrialization, thereby preventing the occurrence of serious environmental issues. It should be noted that EIAs not only provided a structured approach to consultations and operational experiences to resolve environmental problems, but also for a wide range application path for other environmental management policies. © 2023", Effectiveness; Environmental impact assessment; Policy analysis; Technical review; Thermal power industry,1.0
145,A systematic review of Tanzanian environmental impact statements,"Over 30 environmental impact assessments (EIAs) have been carried out in Tanzania to date. The majority of these were required by international development agencies. Legislation to make EIA a national requirement is to be introduced in Tanzania in the near future. The present situation provides an opportunity to assess the current effectiveness of EIA in Tanzania and to determine how it could be improved. Eighteen Tanzanian environmental impact statements (EISs) were reviewed using a procedure modified from that of the UK Institute of Environmental Assessment. In addition to the generally poor standard of Tanzanian EISs, inadequacy of public participation was found to be a key factor in limiting the effectiveness of EIA. Many of the deficiencies found during the EIS review could be rectified relatively easily and this paper seeks to offer some recommendations as to how this could be achieved. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", Development aid; Environmental impact assessment; Tanzania,1.0
146,Enhancing EIA systems in developing countries: A focus on capacity development in the case of Iran,"Sensitivity to an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) system's context is a precondition for being able to suggest recommendation to improving that system. Most recommendations for developing countries take inspiration from developed countries and fall short in their efforts to adapt to the needs of a specific country. In this paper, the authors aim to assess the feasibility of implementing suggested recommendations to enhance Iran's EIA effectiveness. One of the main drawbacks of the Iranian EIA system is deficiency of EIA legislation. However, based on the findings of a review of the literature and semi-structured interviews, it is suggested that by considering contextual factors it is not feasible to overhaul Iran's EIA legislative framework in the short term. Instead, the focus must shift towards increasing environmental awareness and human-capacity development so as to improve the EIA system over time and strengthen EIA legislation. © 2019", Capacity building; Context factors; Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) system; Iran,1.0
147,Outcomes and contextual aspects of strategic environmental assessment in a non-mandatory context: the case of Brazil,"Within the ample body of literature devoted to strategic environmental assessment (SEA) outcomes and the assessment of its effectiveness, it is accepted that the performance of SEA systems is influenced by contextual aspects. Procedural aspects, objectives, guidance, approach, timing, amongst others, are reported as key components of the different dimensions of SEA effectiveness but their linkage to SEA outcomes is yet to be adequately investigated. In this paper, contextual aspects and related outcomes of a non-mandatory SEA system were identified through systematic literature review and personal interviews with key actors of SEA, aiming at the identification of the influence of contextual factors on SEA effectiveness. The findings indicate three main aspects that may explain the lengthy process of introduction of SEA in plan- and policy-making in the country: (i) lack of proper SEA legislation, (ii) the influence of Environmental Impact Assessment practice and (iii) the influence of the environmental licensing culture. Nevertheless, SEA contributes to improving communication between stakeholders along the planning process and to providing a better level of information for lower tiers of decision-making. In spite of the minor influences on the nature of the strategic action, valuable lessons credited to SEA have been learnt. © 2019, © 2019 IAIA.", Brazil; context influence; SEA effectiveness; Strategic environmental assessment,1.0
148,Effectiveness of non-legal EIA guidance from the perspective of consultants in Western Australia,"The provision of environmental impact assessment (EIA) guidance is generally claimed to be beneficial for improving practice through local capacity building. However, to date no studies have investigated their effectiveness. In Western Australia, EIA guidance materials are intended to allow for better environmental protection; increased certainty; enhanced consistency of advice given to Government; proposals to be designed to meet environmental objectives from the outset; and to provide a clearer basis for Government decision-making. Twenty practicing environmental consultants were interviewed about the effectiveness of guidance materials at achieving these objectives. It was found that EIA guidance influenced the practice of consultants and was perceived as effecttive in enhancing the outcomes of the EIA process overall. However, a number of shortfalls were identified. Suggestions are made for increasing the utility of future guidance materials thereby enhance the effectiveness of EIA practice itself.", Capacity building; Consultants; EIA guidance; Practitioner perspectives,1.0
149,Investigating the Driving Factors of Public Participation in Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Projects—A Case Study of China,"Public participation is an important procedure of the environmental impact assessment. Effective public participation is essential to the Public–Private Partnership (PPP) projects as such projects usually exert tremendous impacts on the environment and society. However, in literature, there are few studies investigating the driving factors of public participation in PPP projects, especially in the context of China. To bridge this research gap, this study proposed a theoretical model, which incorporates contextual factors (i.e., perceived benefit and perceived risk) into the classical Theory of Planned Behavior model, to explore the determinants. The initial proposed model was tested using structural equation modeling. Analysis results indicated that attitude towards behavior, subjective norm, perceived risk and perceived behavioral control were the four significant driving factors of public participation in PPP projects, whereas perceived benefit had limited impact. Furthermore, this study evaluated eight public participation approaches in PPP projects. Results revealed that the public were more willing to participate in public decisions through the internet platform, followed by the information disclosure or consultation provided by the government. The research findings derived in this study can provide valuable reference for the government to promulgate proper policies to attract more public participation in PPP projects. Moreover, the research idea and methods used in this study can be popularized in other countries to enhance the public participation in PPP projects. © 2022 by the authors.

150,Optimal expansion of a coastal wastewater treatment and ocean outfall system under uncertainty (I): Simulation analysis,"An ocean outfall system is an integrated engineering system in which a coastal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is connected with a pipeline that discharges wastewater effluent into a body of water. Safety factors to accommodate for uncertainty in modelling of such systems often result in a degree of wastewater treatment that is not cost-effective. This paper presents the first part of an integrated simulation and optimisation analysis to resolve some such uncertainties in the Cornell mixing zone expert system (CORMIX) model by testing it against a laboratory flume. CORMIX is a United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA)-supported mixing zone model for environmental impact assessment of regulatory mixing zones resulting from continuous point source discharges. This model especially emphasises prediction of plume geometry, flow classification, and dilution characteristics within an initial mixing zone of a receiving water body so that compliance with regulatory constraints can be evaluated. With the aid of a flume test, such information may be used as stochastic inputs to an optimisation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of discharge treatment.A total of 19 dye-study scenarios were designed and carried out for single-port (co-flow or counter-flow) and multi-port experiments according to the physical features of the outfall pipe to be expanded in the coastal environment of Taiwan Strait. The flume test showed a good agreement between CORMIX1/CORMIX2 models and the dye-study data. This approach is a stepwise, flexible technique allowing for continuous feedback of the varying design and operating conditions and the observed impacts on coastal waters and may be used to identify the optimal expansion strategy of an integrated coastal WWTP and ocean outfall system such as the case study presented for Kaohsiung, South Taiwan. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.", CORMIX; Flume test; Ocean outfall; Wastewater disposal,0.0
151,Suggested improvements to the australian environmental impact assessment process to benefit marine Megafauna,"Performance of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process is often perceived to be flawed. Testing the process requires investigation of core environmental legislation, regulation and a review of outcomes following an EIA, all of which are rarely undertaken. We use recent coastal development assessments in Australia to complete such a review focusing on the current Commonwealth impact assessment process and its ability to effectively manage risk for protected marine megafauna (turtles, dugongs and coastal dolphins). A range of factors are examined including data sufficiency, project and proponent constraints, knowledge of marine megafauna ecology and relevance of applied monitoring techniques. Challenges associated with identifying measures for effective protection are discussed with changes suggested to the assessment process to achieve an improved conservation goal and supporting truly sustainable development. © 2018, Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Ltd.

152,Stakeholder perceptions of Environmental Management Plans as an environmental protection tool for major developments in the UK,"Insufficient implementation and the lack of legislative requirements for follow-up measures following the approval of projects are consistently highlighted as major shortcomings of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Although adopted over 15. years ago by the World Bank, Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) were only semi-formalised in the UK in 2008 and arguably provide a continuous link or 'bridge' between the EIA process pre-consent and an Environmental Management System (EMS) post-consent. Drawing on twenty-one semi-structured interviews with stakeholders and thematic analysis of their responses, and a broad-scale practitioner survey, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness of EMPs as an environmental protection tool across the project lifecycle for major developments. The findings revealed a mixed picture of EMP effectiveness in practice, with EMPs only partially fulfilling a bridging role between EIA and EMS. There is no 'gold standard' terminology for EMPs, all having slightly different uses, thus presenting different focuses to different stakeholders and further enhancing variation in practice. For many stakeholders, the effectiveness was simply not known, due to the lack of communication and follow-up that still exists. EMP-EMS linkages were shown to be effective from the developer's perspective when a single organisation has involvement across all project phases, though weaknesses occur when multiple parties are involved. Among other stakeholders, knowledge varied significantly; whilst some were in agreement that the linkages worked, many were unaware of the connections and thought of them as two quite separate tools. Stakeholders advocated for the need to make EMPs a legal requirement; for improved communication between stakeholders during EMP implementation and increased documentation of project outcomes; and for EMPs to be consistently written by environmental professionals. Furthermore, weak links in the current process may be improved by providing detailed guidance for organisations on the potential for EMP-EMS linkages, with the additional aim of encouraging stakeholders to broaden their current specialist knowledge on environmental protection tools. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.", ,1.0
153,What approaches exist to evaluate the effectiveness of UK-relevant natural flood management measures? A systematic map,"Background: This systematic map principally sought to understand the different forms of effectiveness that existing studies evaluate in relation to Natural Flood Management (NFM) in the UK with a supplementary question of whether studies engaged with climate change and future flood risk. NFM measures seek to protect, enhance, emulate, or restore the natural function of rivers as part of approaches to flood risk management (FRM). While there is agreement in both academic and practice/policy literature that NFM should be part of a holistic FRM strategy to address current and future flood risk, the specifics of how to expand the application of and consistently implement NFM successfully in practice are less well known. A core focus of this study is on how the effectiveness of NFM measures is evaluated in different studies based on approaches drawn from the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) literature: procedural, substantive, transactive and normative. The systematic map also examines how studies account for climate change, which is a crucial issue given the connections between NFM and climate change adaptation and resilience. Methods: We searched 13 bibliographic databases, Google scholar as a web-based search engine, and 21 organisational sites. Articles were screened by title, abstract, and full text based on defined eligibility criteria. Checks were performed for consistency amongst reviewers. Forms of effectiveness were coded on the basis of the included studies in the systematic map. The quantity and characteristics of the available evidence are summarised with the frequencies of effectiveness forms for each NFM measure are presented in heat maps. Review findings: A total of 216 articles reported eligible studies that were coded as part of the systematic map. Overall, the systematic map shows that the majority of studies considered at least one approach to effectiveness; however, very few studies considered multiple forms of effectiveness. The systematic map also demonstrates that climate change is considered systematically by around one-quarter of studies although many studies make claims about NFM’s effectiveness in the face of future climatic change. Conclusions: NFM can be effective in several different ways owing to their multiple benefits; however, there are evidence gaps around understanding these different forms of effectiveness. This is particularly marked for studies considering transactive and normative effectiveness. Interdisciplinary studies are more likely to consider multiple forms of effectiveness. This systematic map also found that whilst 75% of studies mention future climate change in their studies, only 24.1% contain a systematic consideration of the issue through, for example, using climate change projections. NFM is also at risk of climate change (e.g. through drought) and therefore it is imperative that study designs seek to incorporate consideration of effectiveness under future climate change. Policymakers should be made aware of the lack of understanding of how NFM measures perform under future climate change. © 2023, The Author(s).", Climate change adaptation; Environmental Impact Assessment; Flood risk management; Flooding; Natural Flood Management; Nature-based solutions; River catchments,1.0

In this study, we conducted a rapid assessment on the impact of an ASM gold mine on the vocalizing avian and anuran communities in the buffer zone of the Tambopata National Reserve in Peru. We used seven audio recorders (three near an active mine, two in an abandoned mine, and two in an adjacent forest) to collect 2900 recordings to generate soundscapes and compare acoustic activity patterns of birds and anurans among sites. We identified 56 bird species during the morning chorus (05:00-07:00) and 9 anurans species in the evening chorus (18:00-20:00). Bird species richness was similar between the forest (28 bird species), the abandoned mine (25 species) and the active mine (24 species), but species richness of birds sensitive to disturbance was much lower in the active mine. In contrast, anuran species richness was highest in the active mine (5 species) and lowest in the forest (2 species). Results indicate that acoustic monitoring and soundscape analysis can be effective tools for evaluating the impact of mining activities on vocalizing species, and could become useful tools in rapid environmental impact assessments for mitigation and conservation strategies in ASM mining regions. © 2016, Mongaby.com e-journal.

157,Tracking the land use/land cover change in an area with underground mining and reforestation via continuous Landsat classification,"Understanding the changes in a land use/land cover (LULC) is important for environmental assessment and land management. However, tracking the dynamic of LULC has proved difficult, especially in large-scale underground mining areas with extensive LULC heterogeneity and a history of multiple disturbances. Additional research related to the methods in this field is still needed. In this study, we tracked the LULC change in the Nanjiao mining area, Shanxi Province, China between 1987 and 2017 via random forest classifier and continuous Landsat imagery, where years of underground mining and reforestation projects have occurred. We applied a Savitzky-Golay filter and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based approach to detect the temporal and spatial change, respectively. The accuracy assessment shows that the random forest classifier has a good performance in this heterogeneous area, with an accuracy ranging from 81.92% to 86.6%, which is also higher than that via support vector machine (SVM), neural network (NN), and maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm. LULC classification results reveal that cultivated forest in the mining area increased significantly after 2004, while the spatial extent of natural forest, buildings, and farmland decreased significantly after 2007. The areas where vegetation was significantly reduced were mainly because of the transformation from natural forest and shrubs into grasslands and bare lands, respectively, whereas the areas with an obvious increase in NDVI were mainly because of the conversion from grasslands and buildings into cultivated forest, especially when villages were abandoned after mining subsidence. A partial correlation analysis demonstrated that the extent of LULC change was significantly related to coal production and reforestation, which indicated the effects of underground mining and reforestation projects on LULC changes. This study suggests that continuous Landsat classification via random forest classifier could be effective in monitoring the long-term dynamics of LULC changes, and provide crucial information and data for the understanding of the driving forces of LULC change, environmental impact assessment, and ecological protection planning in large-scale mining areas. © 2019 by the authors.", Continuous Landsat classification; Heterogeneous area; LULC change; Random forest classifier; Underground mining and reforestation,1.0
158,Life cycle assessment of H2O electrolysis technologies,"Hydrogen produced from H2O electrolysis works as an energy carrier and helps to overcome the challenges of intermittent renewable energy sources. At present, no comprehensive environmental impact assessment is available for three commercially H2O electrolysis technologies, namely solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC), polymer electrolyte membrane electrolysis cell (PEMEC), and alkaline electrolysis cell (AEC). The study aimed to provide potential environmental impacts of the electrolysis technologies based on life cycle assessment. Among the investigated 16 impact categories, the stage of critical material use of three H2O electrolysis stacks was identified as the hotspot of environmental impacts. The critical materials were stainless steel and nickel from SOEC, platinum and iridium from PEMEC, and nickel from AEC. Life cycle impact results from PEMEC stack were much higher than these from SOEC and AEC stacks, while electricity played a more important role in the life cycle impact of hydrogen production. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the most effective approach to reducing potential impacts would be to reduce critical materials use on the current status of electrolysis technologies. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC", AEC electrolysis; Life cycle assessment; PEMEC electrolysis; SOEC electrolysis,0.0

The result shows that the northern and northwestern provinces have taken the leading position in the efficiency of water utilization and treatment. The northeastern provinces have largely increased the efficiency but the southwestern provinces have the efficiency declined. Additionally, nearly half of the eastern and central-southern provinces have decreased the efficiency. The decoupling analysis recognized that environmental inspection and the investment in environmental components for new construction projects have a decoupling relationship with water use per capita, COD discharge, and wastewater discharge in most of the provinces, indicating their effective practice in enhancing the performance of water utilization and treatment. On the contrary, the mechanism of environmental impact assessment needs to be advanced to better support the improvement of water utilization and treatment. This study identified the development and the potential improvements of water utilization and treatment efficiency of China on provincial and regional perspectives, and determined the contribution of the selected policy measures to the management of water utilization and treatment, allowing the design of tailored roadmaps to address the regional gaps in water utilization and pollution abatement. © 2020", Decoupling; Policy enforcement; Slack-based measure data envelopment analysis (sbm-dea); Undesirable outputs; Water treatment; Water utilization,0.0
160,"Determinants Influencing the Environmental Impact Assessment Compliance Rate by Industries in Aba City, Southeast, Nigeria","A United Nations (UN) report on the severity of pollution in cities around the world in 2020 rated Aba City, Nigeria, as the most polluted city in the world. This has become a source of worry and embarrassment for environmental policymakers in the country. The matter of whether industries are efficiently managing their wastes came to the fore, and policymakers questioned the compliance of these industries with environmental laws and Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) guidelines and the reasons behind the seemingly non-compliance of the industries with these guidelines. The study aimed to investigate the determinants that influence compliance with EIA guidelines by industries in Aba. A survey research method was employed in the study. Questionnaires and interviews were also used to elicit data from industrialists and environmentalists in the study area. 384 industries were sampled in the study. Principal Component Analysis was used to test the hypothesis. The study revealed seven factors that influenced the compliance rate of EIA guidelines by industries, and they include weak public participation (65.5%), ignorance (54.5%), an effective legal system and legislation (42.4%), the cost of compliance (40.5%), weak coordination along the line of departments (town planning officers and consultants) (35.5%), delay in approval (30.5%), and limited scope (28.9%). It was recommended that the government strengthen the legal system as it relates to the implementation of EIA; then, there is a need to involve affected stakeholders in the preparation of EIA documents. © 2024 Technoscience Publications.

161,Multi-attribute life cycle assessment of preventive maintenance treatments on road pavements for achieving environmental sustainability,"Purpose Although a significant number of environmental protection measures concerning industrial products and processes have emerged over the past few years, similar measures have only started to appear in road construction and related practices. There is a need for understanding what a ""sustainable pavement"" would entail in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. Since environmental impact assessment of major projects is becoming mandatory in many countries, various research projects attempt to evaluate the environmental impact of different pavement materials, technologies, or processes over the road life cycle. To support these efforts, there is a need to measure and describe different aspects of sustainability related to road pavements. In particular, keeping road pavements at high service levels through a preventive maintenance approach during the pavement service life has been proven to provide significant improvement of their performance and reduce their deterioration rate. Methodology This paper describes an innovative methodology to evaluate the environmental impact of preventive maintenance activities. It relates these activities to performance and cost during the service life of the pavement through a multi-attribute ""life cycle cost, performance, and environmental analysis"". Emissions and energy saved adopting several preventive maintenance strategies were computed, relating them to cost and performance. Equipment and materials usually involved in road maintenance practices were also analyzed in order to assess specific fuel consumption and energy spent. An ad hoc index was ultimately created, adopting a script file to evaluate the best strategy through the multi-attribute approach. Results and conclusions Results show how eco-effective it can be to improve pavement management practices on roads by implementing energy efficient treatments and strategies. Furthermore, eco-saving factors could represent a new and innovative feature to be added in the sustainability assessment process for pavements to evaluate different alternatives and assist authorities choosing between different investment solutions as a part of a decision support system. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.", Carbon footprints; Embodied energy; LCA; Multi-attribute approach; Preventive maintenance; Sustainable road pavements,1.0
162,Evaluation of the effectiveness and quality of environmental impact assessment in the federal republic of Germany,"This study uses empirical research of 145 projects on environmental impact assessment (EIA). The researchers generated and tested hypotheses based on questions about the effectiveness and quality of EIA. By means of EIA, aspects of proactive thinking have entered into procedural decisions more than previously presumed and modifications in the spatial dimensions of projects have played an especially prominent role. The three most important factors affecting the scale of general project modifications are: the degree to which the subject matter and methodological aspects of a study are prescribed by §5 of the EIA Act (Scoping); the early, intense involvement of authorities, experts, and third parties in the scoping; and the degree to which the project's effects and impacts are analyzed and forecast in the environmental impact study (EIS).

163,The effectiveness of environmental impact assessment systems in São Paulo and Minas Gerais states,"The effectiveness of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been analyzed through the application of good practice criteria, with emphasis on assessing the quality of studies involved in it. However, such approach is restricted to elements directly linked to the subject of the studies and leaves aside important aspects. The aim of the present study is to analyze the effectiveness of EIA systems through the application of 20 effectiveness criteria to a set of 37 environmental licensing cases in São Paulo (SP) and Minas Gerais (MG) states. The results show that the EIA is effective in both states with respect to procedural aspects. On the other hand, the systems were ineffective when it came to substantive effectiveness aspects such as the promotion of public participation, the development of locational alternatives and the assessment of cumulative effects. These aspects increase the proceeding time and limit the EIA influence on decisions, thus being restricted to adjustments in project designs and to the adoption of mitigation/compensation measures.", Effectiveness criteria; Environmental Impact Assessment systems; Environmental licensing; Environmental policy instruments,1.0
164,"Effectiveness and challenge of environmental impact assessment in industrial park, a case study in Northeast rust belt China","The conventional rough-and-tumble pattern of industrial development in the northeast has severely affected China's sustainable development in recent years. As a result, the industrial park emerged and prospered with the advantages of clear industrial positioning, optimized functional layout and complete support facilities. Nonetheless, for the environmental management of industrial parks, environmental impact assessment (EIA) should be better applied as an upstream environmental protection means. Thus, in three aspects, this study summarizes the research on EIA in the world and analyzes the effectiveness and development of EIA in Northeast China. First, this study analyzed the status and trends of international research in EIA, based on the Web of Science database and the CiteSpace scientometric software. The number of papers continues to rise. Some countries collaborate closely and bring forth new ideas. Research focuses on environmental management, EIA methodology, and energy issues. Research hotspots are public participation and life cycle methods. Second, to specifically investigate the effectiveness of the EIA of the Northeast Industrial Park in recent years has been profitable for the improvement of the Northeast EIA system and for promoting the environmental management approach of the EIA at the micro level. It has been demonstrated that the effect of 70% EIA implementation is relatively significant with high effectiveness. Third, using a SWOT analysis approach, it aims to identify internal strengths and weaknesses, external opportunities and challenges in the development of the Northeast Industrial Park EIA, and propose a future development strategy for the Northeast Industrial Park EIA at the macro level. © 2023 The Authors", China Northeast industrial park; CiteSpace; Effectiveness analysis; Environmental impact assessment; SWOT analysis,1.0

166,Evaluation of the environmental impact assessment system in Egypt,"A formal environmental impact assessment (EIA) system was introduced in Egypt through Environmental Protection Law No. 4 of 1994. This paper evaluates the EIA system in Egypt by using both 'systemic' and 'foundation' evaluation criteria. The methodology is based on an investigation of EIA legislation, a review of guidelines and relevant documents, and interviews with EIA practitioners. The main factors affecting EIA best practice in Egypt are the limited numbers of local experts, inadequate public consultation, lack of environmental data, weak follow-up, and the absence of longterm land-use plans. Recommendations to strengthen the system include improving capacity building, implementing an effective EIA consultants' accreditation system, ensuring effective public participation and access to EIA reports, applying systematic environmental impact statement (EIS) review criteria and promoting environmental awareness. © IAIA 2009.", Egypt; EIA evaluation; Environmental impact assessment,1.0
167,Institutional challenges for corporate participation in payments for ecosystem services (PES): insights from Southeast Asia,"Environmental sustainability relies on the adequate financing of biodiversity conservation—increasingly from the private sector. Meanwhile, corporate sustainability relies on the effective management of natural capital and ecosystem services used in production. Payments for ecosystem services (PES) offers an important practical mechanism for addressing these issues. However, the uptake of corporate-financed PES has been underwhelming, implying that companies may face institutional and motivational challenges to participate in PES. This article presents an assessment framework to determine the conduciveness of PES to real-world corporate environmental strategies and actions, be they (a) voluntary or compliance-based, (b) reactive or proactive, (c) requiring low or high amounts of data, (d) seeking a direct or indirect return on investment (ROI), (e) conducted proximal to or far from the operation site, (f) short-term or long-term, and (g) utilising internal or external resources. Interview data elicited from public, private, and civil sector actors in Thailand and the Philippines highlights key barriers to corporate-financed PES. Results imply companies may be: (1) hesitant to get involved with unknown or uncertain concepts such as ecosystem services; (2) reluctant to fund the technical studies and repeat payments that PES requires; (3) disinterested in direct ROI—instead content with philanthropic projects that can boost public relations; and (4) bound by protocols that restrict the spatial and temporal scales at which PES can operate. To overcome these challenges, policy makers could devise reputational and economic incentives, and incorporate ecosystem services into existing institutions such as environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and ISO 14001. Meanwhile, PES practitioners (government agencies and NGOs) should use quick and simple metrics to quantify ecosystem services, and tolerate buyer willingness-to-pay. Increasing corporate ecosystem service demand, and participation in PES, will likely require firm-level institutional change, and business strategies to improve supply chain management and mitigate the negative effects of environmental and climate change. © 2018, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.", Carbon; Corporate environmentalism; Corporate social responsibility (CSR); Environmental management; Environmental services; Strategic management,1.0

How much EIA helps sustainable development is largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that it is more than is typically assumed, through a plethora of causes, including emancipation of stakeholders and incremental change in the bureaucracy, companies and scientific institutions. To enhance the effectiveness of EIA, research should focus more on theory about the nature and operation of diverse causal processes, even though the concepts, methods and analytical challenges would be substantial. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", Decision-making; Effectiveness; Environmental impact assessment; Sustainable development; Theory,1.0
169,Sustainability Assessment of Renewable Energy Technologies in Context to India Using Multicriteria Analysis with and without Incorporating Risk Analysis,"Sustainability assessment at a national scale is a complex task that ought to be seen with a range of conflicting indicators and multicriteria analysis (MCA) is the best approach that can address these conflicts. The study aims for a comprehensive sustainability assessment of renewable energy (RE) technologies in India based on MCA and examines the impact of associated social and environmental risks on the overall sustainability ranking. Large hydropower is evaluated as the most sustainable RE technology in context to India under selected indicators. Contrary to this, large hydropower has also been identified with the highest social and environmental risks. Therefore, in a developing country like India, the techno-economic advantages of large hydropower with its significant untapped potential cannot be overlooked. Hence, there arises a need to enhance the environmental impact assessment (EIA) process. Thus, the study recommends a transparent process for public participation in EIA for comprehensive and effective social and environmental risk management of the project to achieve the goal of sustainable development.  © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.", Multicriteria analysis; renewable energy; risk analysis; social and environmental risks; sustainability assessment; sustainability indicators,1.0
170,Practical Approaches for Providing Empirical Data on Seabird Behavior and Prey Assemblages in Tidal Channels,"Persisting knowledge gaps relating to the ecological context and potential environmental impacts of marine renewable energy (MRE) devices continue to add substantial costs and uncertainty to MRE projects globally. Increasingly sophisticated technological approaches to environmental monitoring can have fundamental non-trivial shortcomings for environmental impact assessment (EIA), whilst substantial practical and financial costs of deployments can prevent their application. For the tidal stream energy (TSE) sector, there is a need for practical and cost-effective methods that can provide site-specific information on predator behavior and associated prey assemblages. Considering existing knowledge of animal communities in tidal channel environments, a proportional approach using shore-based observation and baited fish trap methods was developed. During April 2021, a trial of these methods was conducted in tidal channel environments in Shetland, UK. The practical application of the proposed approach is demonstrated here with results from three tidal channels including Bluemull Sound, the site of active TSE installations (the Shetland Tidal Array). Observation of predator behavior across the study sites are reported for great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo and European shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis. Seabird diving data calculated from the shore-based observations provided metrics relevant to informing EIA and collision risk modelling including dive duration, dives per minute, and % time underwater. Fish trap deployments targeted the benthic and demersal prey of these predators in the three study sites and across a range of depths and hydrodynamic conditions. A variety of fish and invertebrate species known to be important components of benthic-foraging seabird diet were successfully captured by the traps, providing basic biological information on the prey assemblages observed in each site. The fish species observed in the highest abundance were saithe Pollachius virens and cod Gadus morhua. Benefits, limitations, and applications of this approach are discussed along with various factors relating to the performance of both methods. The shore-based observations rapidly identified relevant patterns in predator foraging activity which informed the targeted deployment of fish traps to provide complementary prey data. This novel combined approach has potential to reduce costs and uncertainty in EIA and for supporting the responsible development of the MRE industry.

171,The role of lifecycle analysis in environmental management: general panacea or one of several useful paradigms?,"Lifecycle analysis (LCA) has the potential to serve as an effective environmental management tool which, used appropriately, could assist manufacturers and consumers alike to improve their environmental awareness and performance. However, some restraint is called for in promoting LAC as the ""environmental management tool of the 1990s'. Some of the currently proposed applications for LCA appear too broad in context for what is, essentially, a product-based environmental assessment procedure. These applications fit more appropriately within the remit of other environmental impact assessment and environmental auditing. The definitive role of LCA within environmental management requires further examination and clarification. -from Authors", ,0.0
172,Environmental impact assessment in an uncertain environment,"'Green' manufacturing has become an important issue in industry, driven by regulations governing manufacturing emissions, growing worldwide environmental certification requirements (ISO 14000) and an emerging consumer preference for ecolated products. Establishing a quantitative and effective assessment model to assess the environmental impact of manufacturing processes for a product has become important. This paper focuses on analysing the uncertainty of weighting factors in an environmental impact assessment and applying fuzzy set theory to determine the vague or fuzzy weighting factors of the various environmental impact categories. A case study demonstrates that the fuzzy set-based model can effectively account for the vagueness and uncertainty of information being used for environmental impact assessments. The proposed fuzzy model is useful, not only for evaluating the environmental impact of a manufacturing process, but also for selecting processes when environmental impact is one of the factors to be considered.", ,1.0

The inability of governments to site new waste disposal facilities can be traced to a slavish adherence to planning's most common paradigm, the rational comprehensive model. The article also addresses whether the extensive public consultation programs associated with waste EIAs are effective. The study concludes with a discussion of how the communicative action of planning should be researched in waste management to develop more efficient and less socially divisive planning programs. © 2007, Sage Publications.

174,Appraising the role of relationships between regulators and consultants for effective EIA,"The role of relationships between regulators and consultants engaged in environmental impact assessment (EIA) is explored. A Partnering Agreement between Western Australian regulators and consultants gave rise to a survey and interviews with representatives of these EIA practitioners to understand levels of cooperation between them and ways to improve EIA practice locally. A mixture of quantitative and qualitative responses are presented with an emphasis on practitioner comments reproduced in their own words and 'voice'. The results suggest that while relationships are strained because of staff resources and levels of expertise brought about by a major resource boom in recent years, there is a great desire for cooperation and collaboration. Greater clarification and understanding of each stakeholder's purpose and role in the EIA process along with opportunities for EIA practitioners to interact, communicate and socialise are identified as positive ways forward. The value of establishing the relatively simple Partnering Agreement approach is demonstrated and is put forward as something that practitioners internationally might equally benefit from as a means of improving the effectiveness of EIA practice. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

175,Environmental impact assessment: Retrospect and prospect,"The widespread experience of environmental impact assessment (EIA) as an anticipatory environmental management tool has generated a considerable debate over the extent to which it is achieving its purposes. This has been measured in terms of EIA 'effectiveness', especially as discussion has moved away from issues of procedural implementation, to the more substantive goals of EIA and its place within broader decision-making contexts. Empirical studies have revealed the relatively weak degree of influence on planning decisions that is being exerted by EIA, which is increasingly being attributed to its rationalist beginnings. This article seeks to direct this debate towards the founding political purposes of EIA which, it is argued, provide a neglected, yet strong, basis for EIA reform. A number of illustrative suggestions are made as a result of this redirection, to enable EIA to adopt a more determinative role in decision making and to contribute to more sustainable patterns of development planning. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

176,Life cycle assessment of a retrofit wastewater nutrient recovery system in metro Manila,"The increase in water pollution from nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen has prompted the Philippine government to issue stringent regulatory standards for wastewater effluent quality. Hence, two alternatives are being proposed to be integrated in the current wastewater treatment plant in the Philippines: biological nutrient removal and nutrient recovery systems. Biological nutrient removal technologies (BNRT) utilize microorganisms to minimize the nutrient content in the effluent streams to the standard limit while leaving high nutrient concentrations to the sludge that is typically transported as waste to landfill. The nutrient recovery system aims to recover phosphorus and nitrogen in the form of struvite (NH4MgPO46H2O) fertiliser from sludge through chemical precipitation. The two proposed systems have been studied in other settings but their effectiveness has not been studied in the Metro Manila setting. There is a need to systematically assess the environmental effects brought about by the proposed systems in Metro Manila, whether beneficial or adverse, in the context of agriculture, food and energy consumption, and wastewater. A holistic evaluation of the environmental benefits and burdens was done using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework considering a cradle-to-grave approach of three scenarios: 1) current wastewater treatment system scenario; 2) biological nutrient recovery technology; and 3) nutrient recovery system. The environmental impact assessment was done using IMPACT2002+ methodology with the following impact indicators: human health, ecosystem quality, climate change and resources. The life cycle assessment of the scenarios shows the potential of the proposed retrofit wastewater systems for Metro Manila that extends to a more sustainable approach in dealing with issues such as water pollution, climate change, resource depletion and even food security. Moreover, a baseline understanding of the food-water-energy-nutrient nexus in the Philippines was established which can be the basis for future life cycle sustainability assessment studies. © 2018, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.", ,0.0
177,"Development of analysis tools for social, economic and ecological effects of water reuse","The full implementation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) in Europe will contribute to obtain treated wastewaters of quite high quality that could be reused for certain applications or improved by polishing steps for uses with higher quality requirements. Even though reclaimed water reuse is currently implemented in many European countries, mainly for irrigation, its potential has not yet been exploited in many areas. In fact, a decisive factor to achieve a higher percentage of water reuse is the establishment of effective incentives, which in many instances will be of either an economic or a regulatory nature. The limiting factor for water reuse can in many circumstances be the quality of the water available linked to the treatment processes (technology) and potential hazards for secondary users. In any case, its economic viability needs a careful cost-benefit analysis for the various parties involved to be carried out. However, some water reuse implementation projects have failed because some other key factors, such as social awareness or associated ecological effects, were not accounted for. Thus, the consideration of regulatory, economic, technological, social and environmental factors seems essential to successfully accomplish a reclaimed water reuse project. Feasibility studies can contribute to obtain the success in the implementation of a water reuse project. Within AQUAREC a feasibility study methodology for the performance of water reuse projects has been developed, considering the above mentioned key factors and providing the tools for their analysis. These guidelines aim at assisting the different stakeholders (administration, engineering companies, water management bodies, etc.) involved in the implementation of a water reuse programme in a specific area. AQUAREC Handbook on Feasibility Studies for Water Reuse Systems, publicly available, deals with all information needs necessary to successfully face a water reuse project. Background information data collection support, technology options evaluation or environmental impact assessment guidelines are offered in this publication.

178,Evaluating EIA implementation in China: An empirical study of 161 EIA judicial cases,"To play EIA's role as a preventative and participatory tool, the 2003 Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Law was significantly amended in 2016 to optimize EIA approval authority and procedure, raise project developers' violation costs, and clarify public participation rules. This article evaluates how the main provisions of this Law have been enforced in practice by analyzing 161 judicial cases collected. Case analysis reveals the main case typology, plaintiffs, violations concerned, and environmental agencies' losing rate. More specifically, the majority of these 161 cases are brought by project developers, challenging the legality of penalty decisions and disapproval decisions imposed on them. The dominant form of violation is construction without EIA approval, a chronic challenge haunting China's EIA enforcement. The interested parties are admitted with standing in most lawsuits filed against EIA approval, mainly due to the relaxed standing requirements. Nevertheless, the losing rate of environmental agencies in selected EIA cases is higher than that of general environmental cases, raising doubts about the effectiveness of the 2016 EIA Law's efforts to promote a more efficient and prudent approval procedure. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.", Administrative penalty; Duty performance; EIA approval; Environmental impact assessment; Standing,1.0

180,A modelling framework to predict bat activity patterns on wind farms: An outline of possible applications on mountain ridges of North Portugal,"Worldwide ecological impact assessments of wind farms have gathered relevant information on bat activity patterns. Since conventional bat study methods require intensive field work, the prediction of bat activity might prove useful by anticipating activity patterns and estimating attractiveness concomitant with the wind farm location. A novel framework was developed, based on the stochastic dynamic methodology (StDM) principles, to predict bat activity on mountain ridges with wind farms. We illustrate the framework application using regional data from North Portugal by merging information from several environmental monitoring programmes associated with diverse wind energy facilities that enable integrating the multifactorial influences of meteorological conditions, land cover and geographical variables on bat activity patterns. Output from this innovative methodology can anticipate episodes of exceptional bat activity, which, if correlated with collision probability, can be used to guide wind farm management strategy such as halting wind turbines during hazardous periods. If properly calibrated with regional gradients of environmental variables from mountain ridges with windfarms, the proposed methodology can be used as a complementary tool in environmental impact assessments and ecological monitoring, using predicted bat activity to assist decision making concerning the future location of wind farms and the implementation of effective mitigation measures. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.", Acoustic monitoring; Bat activity patterns; Ecological modelling; Environmental risk assessment; Stochastic Dynamic Methodology (StDM); Wind farms,1.0

Urbanization strategic environmental assessment integration technology system (SEA-ITS) is composed of ""3S"" (RS, GIS and GPS), environmental expert system and environmental model system, coupling with appropriate SEA working process closely. In this paper, the structure and components of SEA-ITS are analyzed based on Chinese characteristics, meanwhile methods to fulfill the following system functions are discussed: urbanization SEA inquiring, analysis, discrimination, assessment, prediction, decision-making and output. Moreover, methods and technologies employed in different urbanization SEA hierarchies are summarized. As a case study, urbanization SEA-ITS is applied in Changchun City to solving complex real problems. Methods such as system dynamics and grey cluster are adopted to achieve the environmental impact assessment on the eco-industrial system planning. It is revealed that the system designed is capable of reflecting the dynamic behavior of eco-industrial system under different scenarios, meanwhile accomplishing strategy optimization and supplying scientific reference.

183,A new paradigm for Environmental Assessment (EA) in Korea,"Over the last 30 years, Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in Korea has played an important role in decision-making processes particularly for environmentally sensitive projects. However, the EIA system alone has sometimes not been effective enough to ensure the successful resolution of environmental concerns. In order to compensate for the limitations of the EIA system, a new assessment system called Prior Environmental Review System (PERS), which is relevant to Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) in some aspects, was introduced in 1993. PERS aims to balance development and preservation by identifying possible environmental impacts of some administrative plans mainly related to development projects in the early stages of planning. However, PERS still appeared to have some weak points such as a limited range of subjects to be assessed, and weakness of tiering (or vertical integration) from PERS to EIA. Therefore, the necessity for reform of the Korean Environmental Assessment (EA) system, including PERS, was raised. In response, the Korean government sought to establish its policy direction for implementing SEA by enhancing the objectivity and expertise of PERS. The policy was approved by the National Assembly in May 2005, and went into effect in June 2006. The introduction of SEA, by enhancing PERS, provides a framework for a system of EA from the strategic level, including PPPs, to the project level. Yet, despite such improvements, some managerial and technical problems associated with subsequent EA implementation remain. This paper critically reviews the evolution of the EA system in Korea and suggests essential improvements for the current EA system based on experiences of implementation of both EIA and SEA since June 2006, in the context of international good practice. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

184,The combination of an Environmental Management System and Life Cycle Assessment at the territorial level,"A framework to include a Life Cycle Assessment in the significance evaluation of the environmental aspects of an Environmental Management System has been studied for some industrial sectors, but there is a literature gap at the territorial level, where the indirect impact assessment is crucial. To overcome this criticality, our research proposes the Life Cycle Assessment as a framework to assess environmental aspects of public administration within an Environmental Management System applied at the territorial level. This research is structured in two parts: the design of a new methodological framework and the pilot application for an Italian municipality. The methodological framework designed supports Initial Environmental Analysis at the territorial level thanks to the results derived from the impact assessment phase. The pilot application in an Italian municipality EMAS registered demonstrates the applicability of the framework and its effectiveness in evaluating the environmental impact assessment for direct and indirect aspects. Through the discussion of the results, we underline the growing knowledge derived by this research in terms of the reproducibility and consistency of the criteria to define the significance of the direct and indirect environmental aspects for a local public administration. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.", Case study; EMAS registration; Environmental Management System; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipality,1.0

On the one hand, this globally unparalleled initiative is expected to foster economic growth, but on the other hand, it can have substantial environmental implications. The BRI creates new challenges and opportunities for environmental governance as new actor constellations emerge in BRI host countries to plan and construct large infrastructure projects. Although China has outlined its vision of building a “green Belt and Road”, it remains unknown how it unfolds on the ground. As an example of a BRI project with clear environmental implications, we present a case study of the Bar-Boljare highway in Montenegro. Based on expert interviews, we elucidate the complex web of actors and contractual arrangements involved, and demonstrate how internal and external actors exert influence on domestic environmental governance in this EU candidate country in the Western Balkans. We find that Montenegro has substantial agency over the environmental governance of this BRI project, but shows little concern over the environmental impacts of the project. Environmental issues could have been prevented during the spatial planning phase, but important governance instruments such as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) were of limited effectiveness due to its fast and late completion, lack of assessment of alternative routes, and the limited enforcement of the provisions therein. International institutions like the EU or UNESCO have drawn on their normative power in environmental governance to demand greater environmental safeguards from Montenegrin authorities. This case is illustrative of a larger set of BRI projects which run the risk of falling short on sustainability due to a lack of environmentally sound and transparent planning and implementation. © 2022 The Authors", Environmental planning; Land use; Southeastern Europe; Sustainable development; Transport,1.0
186,Reflections on the Consideration of Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Environmental Impact Assessment,"Environmental impact assessment (EIA) involves assessing the implications of proposed activities on the environment to inform decisions about whether those actions should proceed and under what conditions. Efforts are being made to incorporate climate change considerations into EIA internationally, but the assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions poses particular challenges. This article compares the incorporation of GHG emissions into EIA in two jurisdictions: Canada (under the Impact Assessment Act 2019) and Western Australia (under the Environmental Protection Act 1986). Four questions are considered, relating to screening and scoping; information requirements; decision-making and condition setting; and post-approval activities. Key differences between the two jurisdictions were found in relation to screening and scoping (Western Australia applies an emissions threshold while Canada utilizes a project list coupled with tailored guidelines); decision-making (Western Australia generally considers a straight line trajectory to net zero by 2050 as acceptable whereas Canada considers emissions in the context of international commitments and against other sustainability considerations); and post-approval activities (a strength of the Western Australian system is mechanisms enabling review and tightening of GHG conditions over time). It will be important to continue to review the effectiveness of EIA as a tool for climate mitigation as practice evolves.

187,Using social data in strategic environmental assessment to conserve biodiversity,"Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is increasingly used to assess land use plans in a way that is broader in spatial, temporal and conceptual scope than traditional Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Meanwhile, conservation scientists have recognised that successful biodiversity conservation outcomes rely on information about both biological priorities and the feasibility of undertaking conservation actions. SEA provides a framework for integrating information on the social determinants of conservation feasibility with supporting environmental legislation in order to achieve enhanced conservation outcomes. In this paper we argue that data on the social context of land use plans are vital to ensure effective biodiversity conservation outcomes that result from SEAs. We explore the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (1999) (EPBC Act) as a case example of how the integration of these data can be practically achieved within an existing legal process. While a range of social data is relevant to this type of assessment, we focus on the use of spatially-referenced social data in the context of land use planning. When applied to the design and implementation of land use plans, this type of information can improve the acceptability of conservation actions, enhance environmental stewardship, and minimise land use conflict through taking stock of the values and attitudes (precursors to behaviour) that are relevant to proposed land use change and conservation action. Through exploring the integration of these data into each of the stages of SEA under the EPBC Act, we show that opportunities exist to strengthen the effectiveness of SEA in delivering conservation outcomes without altering existing legal processes. Yet, for this to be done effectively, practitioners need to be cognisant of a range of theoretical and methodological challenges related to the generation and interpretation of these data, as well as the socio-political context in which they are applied. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.", Biodiversity; Conservation opportunity; Environmental impact assessment; Social data; Strategic environmental assessment,1.0
188,Frontier issues in international ocean governance: Japan's discharge of nuclear contaminated water into the sea,"This paper aimed at explore international ocean governance issues through the perspective of Japan's nuclear contaminated water discharge to the sea. This paper analyzes the core issue of Japan's plan to discharge nuclear contaminated water into the ocean from the perspectives of Japan's international legal obligation, law enforcement issues, and judicial issues after integrated analyzing academic research paper and cases. Japan has obligations such as timely notification, information disclosure, environmental impact assessment, and avoidance of transboundary harm. Intergovernmental and non-governmental international organizations, such as IAEA, IMO and WHO should play a role in setting up an international group of experts to carry out monitoring and assessment, and whose positions and attitudes are important references for judging Japan's behavior. Cases heard before ICJ, ITLOS, and advisory opinion proceeding could provide reference from the judicial perspective on the issue of transboundary harm and proof of damages. Furthermore, this paper discusses the response strategies that the international community especially the opponents may adopt, including promoting the adoption of relevant treaties, take a combination of requesting advisory opinion and file arbitration, establish effective international monitoring mechanism, and engage in close communication with stakeholders. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd", Advisory opinion; International Court of Justice; International legal obligations; Japan nuclear contaminated water; Ocean governance,0.0
189,"Logical framework approach to project planning, socio-economic analysis and to monitoring and evaluation services: A smallholder rice project","The retrospective application of the logical framework approach to the planning of a smallholder rice production project is reviewed. The assumptions and risks contained in the project's logical framework matrix are equated to those considered in sensitivity and risk analysis. Distinctions between project efficiency, effectiveness and impact are examined, as is the role of the project manager in the achievement of the project outputs, objective and sector goals. A socio-economic issue and the provision of monitoring and evaluation services are examined. Nowadays an environmental impact assessment report and socio-economic baseline studies would be required prior to project appraisal. Increased consideration would also be given to socio-economic factors in relation to the likely achievement of crop production targets. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", Logical framework; Project appraisal; Project monitoring,1.0
190,Environmental impact assessment and environmental audit in large-scale public infrastructure construction: The case of the qinghai-tibet railway,"Large-scale public infrastructure projects have featured in China's modernization course since the early 1980s. During the early stages of China's rapid economic development, public attention focused on the economic and social impact of high-profile construction projects. In recent years, however, we have seen a shift in public concern toward the environmental and ecological effects of such projects, and today governments are required to provide valid environmental impact assessments prior to allowing large-scale construction. The official requirement for the monitoring of environmental conditions has led to an increased number of debates in recent years regarding the effectiveness of Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and Governmental Environmental Audits (GEAs) as environmental safeguards in instances of large-scale construction. Although EIA and GEA are conducted by different institutions and have different goals and enforcement potential, these two practices can be closely related in terms of methodology. This article cites the construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway as an instance in which EIA and GEA offer complementary approaches to environmental impact management. This study concludes that the GEA approach can serve as an effective follow-up to the EIA and establishes that the EIA lays a base for conducting future GEAs. The relationship that emerges through a study of the Railway's construction calls for more deliberate institutional arrangements and cooperation if the two practices are to be used in concert to optimal effect. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.", Construction project; Environmental audit; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental performance; Large-scale construction program; Qinghai-tibet railway,1.0
191,Role of local town planning authorities in building collapse in Nigeria: evidence from Enugu metropolis,"The current spate of building collapse in Nigeria has continued to attract research efforts to unravel the causes and possible remedies. Although cases of building collapse in Nigeria has been associated with several factors, those factors associated with building plan approval process have not adequately investigated, especially in a rapidly expanding colonial city of Enugu. The study investigated the role of local town planning authorities in the increasing cases of collapsed buildings in Nigeria using Enugu as a case study. A well-structured questionnaire was administered to the three Chief Town Planners in the three planning approval offices and oral interviews randomly selected 30 developers in ongoing construction projects within Enugu metropolis were conducted. Using content analysis and descriptive statistics the data collected were analyzed. It was observed that due to poor staffing and lack of engagement of building professionals, the planning approval authorities were not effective in scrutinizing, vetting and evaluating building drawings submitted for approval as well as in supervising and monitoring the level of compliance of buildings under construction with the operational building codes and bye-laws in the study area. The study concludes that these lapses in the roles of local building approval authorities can contribute to the increasing cases of collapsed buildings in Enugu Metropolis. It recommends that government should take proactive steps by engaging the right number of building professionals in her planning approval offices and ensuring strict enforcement of the existing physical development legislation and punishment of offenders. © 2020; Building professionals; Building collapse; Planning approval; Building legislation; Enugu metropolis; Civil engineering; Environmental science; Environmental engineering; Environmental Impact Assessment; Arts and humanities; Architecture © 2020", Architecture; Arts and humanities; Building collapse; Building legislation; Building professionals; Civil engineering; Enugu metropolis; Environmental engineering; Environmental Impact Assessment; Environmental science; Planning approval,0.0
192,Environmental performance evaluation of a fast mask image projection stereolithography process through time and energy modeling,"The emergence of additive manufacturing (AM) has potential for dramatic changes in labor productivity and economic welfare. With the growth of AM, understanding of the sustainability performance of relevant technologies is required. Toward that goal, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) approach is undertaken to evaluate an AM process. A novel fast mask image projection stereolithography (MIP-SL) process is investigated for the production of six functional test parts. The materials, energy, and wastes are documented for parts fabricated using this process. The EIA is completed for human health, ecosystem diversity, and resource costs using the ReCiPe 2008 impact assessment method. It is noted that process energy, in the form of electricity, is the key contributor for all three damage types. The results are used to depict the underlying relationship between energy consumed and the environmental impact of the process. Thus, to facilitate prediction of process energy utilization, a mathematical model relating shape complexity and dimensional size of the part with respect to part build time and washing time is developed. The effectiveness of this model is validated using data from real-time process energy monitoring. This work quantifies the elemental influence of design features on AM process energy consumption and environmental impacts. While focused on the environmental performance of the fast MIP-SL process, the developed approach can be extended to evaluate other AM processes and can encompass a triple bottom line analysis approach for sustainable design by predicting environmental, economic, and social performance of products.

193,Application of gradient boosting model to forecast corporate green innovation performance,"Corporate green innovation performance can serve as a critical tool for policymakers to identify the best practice and provide support to micro-entities in need. Accurate forecasting of corporate green innovation performance plays a vital role in innovation incentives by simulating the effects of regulations and strategies. Based on the data of China’s A-share listed companies during 2010–2020, this paper elaborates the gradient boosting algorithm to predict the corporate green innovation performance and compares the prediction results of the gradient boosting model with the linear model, the decision tree model, and the random forest model. Subsequently, it examines the effectiveness of the influencing factors related to the enterprise’s internal driving mechanism and external policy pressure in promoting corporate green innovation performance. It finds that: 1) The gradient boosting model outperforms other methods in its predictive effect. 2) An enterprise’s resource base is a critical factor influencing its green innovation activities, and in particular, the influence of financial indicators on corporate green innovation performance has a significant incentive effect, indicating that the impetus from enterprises’ internal driving mechanism is crucial for enterprises’ green transformation. 3) The effect of secondary indicators is heterogeneous. In the command-based environmental regulation tools, the administrative penalties can activate enterprises’ green innovation better than the approvals of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) documents for construction projects do; as for the incentive-based environmental regulation, investment in pollution control projects has an apparent inducing effect on the corporate green innovation performance, while the environmental tax presents an inverted U-shape, implying that overly stringent taxation crowds out the corporate green innovation performance. 4) Similarly, in the operating capacity indicators, the increasing operating income growth rate can trigger the improvement of green innovation performance; nevertheless, the total asset turnover ratio shows a suppressing effect. The key to promoting corporate green innovation performance lies in effectively regulating the enterprises’ internal driving mechanism and the rational choice of external policy tools. This study helps to prospectively identify how corporate green innovation performance changes and provides theoretical guidance and micro evidence for the policymakers on choosing environmental regulation tools and for enterprises on adjusting the resource bases.

195,Improving the quality of environmental impacts assessment reports: effectiveness of alternatives analysis and public involvement in JICA supported projects,"This study examined the key factors for improving the quality of environmental impact assessment reports through statistical tests and path analysis. The Lee-Colley review package was used to review the quality of the samples of 120 reports prepared by the Japan International Cooperation Agency dating from 2001 to 2012. The result of the study showed that alternatives analysis and public involvement could be key factors for improving the quality of reports. When the number of public involvement stages went up, the number of evaluation criteria for alternatives analysis showed an increasing trend and the quality of the reports improved. Finally, the study pointed out the effectiveness of alternatives analysis with a wide range of evaluation criteria and public involvement for improving the quality of reports. Further research is needed to explore alternatives analysis and public involvement in more depth as well as to improve the effectiveness of their linkage via more case studies. © 2016 IAIA.", Alternatives analysis; path analysis; public involvement; statistical tests; the Lee-Colley review package,1.0
196,Perceptions of governments towards mitigating the environmental impacts of expressway construction projects: A case of China,"The enormous impacts of expressway construction projects (ECPs) on the natural environment worldwide have created the urgency of involving both governments and contractors in the construction process. Governments play a substantial role in motivating contractors to adopt effective technologies and management paradigms to mitigate the environmental impacts of ECPs. A proper perception of this public matter and relevant management approaches is a prerequisite for governments to fulfill such a role. Using China as a case, the purpose of this study is to examine the scope of the environmental impacts that governments perceive and the evolution of the perceptions into management approaches. Response of provincial governments to environmental impact assessment for 132 ECPs was compiled as the materials of the study. Data were retrieved from the materials by using the text mining method. The data analysis reveals that: (1) governments follow the pressure-state-response framework to express their concerns over the environmental impacts; (2) the management approaches that governments consider are embedded in the impacts; (3) governments management approaches are intended to emphasize an ecological perspective. The research findings contribute as a cornerstone for researchers to examine the performance of governments on this public affair and shed some lights on same practices in other countries. © 2019", Environmental impact assessment; Expressway construction projects; Governments; Perceptions; Sustainable construction,1.0
197,New methodological approaches in environmental impact assessment,"Environmental impact assessment represents an effective preventive system against damage to the environment that is based on prognosis and assessment of presumed positive and negative impacts of development projects and policies. Primarily the acts on environmental impact assessment have had great influence on decision making processes in the sphere of environmental, social and economic development on national and global levels. The article analyses the contemporary research priorities on the basis of the results of important international conferencies and workshops, numerous of methodological guidelines, textbooks, final reports and studies in the area of environmental impact assessment. The main priorities in basic research are: cumulative effects analysis, decision analysis and relationships between the strategic environmental assessment and concept of sustainability; in applied research they are: evaluation of the results of the monitoring and post-project analysis, involvement of public in the assessment process and improvement of the effectiveness of the decision-making processes.", ,1.0
198,A full time series imagery and full cycle monitoring (FTSI-FCM) algorithm for tracking rubber plantation dynamics in the Vietnam from 1986 to 2022,"Accurate mapping of rubber plantations in Southeast Asia is critical for sustainable plantation management and ecological and environmental impact assessment. Despite extensive research on rubber plantation mapping, studies have largely been confined to provincial scales, with the few country-scale assessments showing significant disagreement in both spatial distribution and area estimates. These discrepancies primarily stem from persistent cloud cover in tropical regions and limited temporal resolution of datasets that inadequately capture the full phenological cycles of rubber trees. To address these issues, we propose the Full Time Series Satellite Imagery and Full-Cycle Monitoring (FTSI-FCM) algorithm for mapping spatial distribution and establishment year of rubber plantations in Vietnam, a country experienced significant rubber expansion over the past decades. The FTSI-FCM algorithm initially employs the LandTrendr approach—an established forest disturbance detection algorithm—to identify the land use changes during the plantation establishment phase. We enhance this process through a spatiotemporal correction scheme to accurately determine the establishment years and maturity phases of the plantations. Subsequently, the algorithm identifies rubber plantations through a random forest algorithm by integrating features from three temporal phases: canopy transitions from rubber seedlings to mature plantations, phenological changes during mature stages, and phenological-spectral characteristic during the mapping year. This approach leverages an extensive time series of Landsat images dating back to the late 1980s, complemented by Sentinel-2 images since 2015. For the mapping year, these data are further enhanced by the inclusion of PALSAR-2 L-band Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) and very high-resolution Planet optical imagery. When applied in Vietnam—a leading rubber producer with complex cultivation conditions— the FTSI-FCM algorithm yielded highly reliable maps of rubber distribution (Overall Accuracy, OA = 93.75%, F1-score = 0.93) and establishment years (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.25 years) for 2022 (referred to as FTSI-FCM_2022). These results outperformed previous mappings, such as WangR_2021 (OA = 75.00%, F1-score = 0.71), in both spatial distribution and area estimates. The FTSI-FCM_2022 map revealed a total rubber plantation area of 754,482 ha, closely matching reported statistics of 727,900 ha and showing strong correlation provincial statistics (R2 = 0.99). Spatial analysis indicated that over 90% of rubber plantations are located within 15°N latitude, below 600 m in elevation, on slopes under 15°, and were established after 2000. Notably, there has been no significant expansion of rubber plantations into higher elevations or steeper slopes since 1990s, suggesting the effectiveness of sustainable rubber cultivation management practices in Vietnam. The FTSI-FCM algorithm demonstrates substantial potential for mapping rubber plantations in major producing areas such as Southeast Asia, thereby supporting sustainable development decision-making in the natural rubber industry. © 2024", Establishment year; Landsat/Sentinel-2; Phenological features; Rubber plantations; Vietnam,1.0
199,"Sustainability in the Environmental Impact Assessment and ecological inputs for quarry activities in Melaka Tengah, Melaka","In Malaysia the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was introduced in 1988, as a measure of sustainability in developmental projects. The aim of this study was to examine the compliance with the guidelines and ecological adequacy of the information input in the preparation of the EIA report. The ecological input is an important part of the EIA. In this study, the choice was made for two EIA reports in Melaka which was sent to the DOE for approval. The method used was according to the revised package of measurement for 12 ecological input criteria in the EIA report. The results of this study found many omissions in the provision of ecological inputs and disobedience. Among the twelve criteria for assessment of the ecological inputs available in the description of the existing environment, consultants were not sensitive enough to identify the sample geology, flora and fauna and aquatic habitat. The review of the EIA report showed there were reports describing the effects of individual and yet try not to quantify these effects. For further description of mitigation measures to the physical aspect, no emphasis was made on the effectiveness of the proposed measures. In addition, mitigation measures were implemented. The residual impact was discussed briefly in both reports. The results of the survey in the vicinity of the project site also found a lot of environmental impact of specific ecosystems and flora and fauna of the river ecosystem. The dust pollution also affected the surrounding community. Overall, both the EIA report for the project was found to be less effective including information regarding ecological input and compliance aspects. A comprehensive and commitment of all parties is crucial to ensure continuity in the development process that can be achieved through improvements in the preparation of the EIA report mainly for information and compliance with ecological guidelines. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.", Assessment; Ecolocigal input; Environmental Impact Assessment; Quarry activity,1.0
